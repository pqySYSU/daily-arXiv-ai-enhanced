*Tanghui Jia,Dongyu Yan,Dehao Hao,Yang Li,Kaiyi Zhang,Xianyi He,Lanjiong Li,Jinnan Chen,Lutao Jiang,Qishen Yin,Long Quan,Ying-Cong Chen,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraShape 1.0 is a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity geometry generation using a two-stage pipeline with coarse structure synthesis followed by detailed refinement, supported by improved data processing and voxel-based localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation that can work effectively with limited training resources while producing detailed, high-quality results.

Method: Two-stage generation pipeline: 1) Coarse global structure synthesis, 2) Detailed refinement. Uses comprehensive data processing with watertight processing and quality filtering. Decouples spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis via voxel-based refinement at fixed locations with RoPE encoding.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation, trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets despite limited resources.

Conclusion: UltraShape 1.0 demonstrates effective 3D geometry generation through a scalable diffusion framework with improved data processing and structured refinement, with code and models to be released for future research.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce UltraShape 1.0, a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage generation pipeline: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry. To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation. All code and trained models will be released to support future research.

*Shijing Wang,Chaoqun Cui,Yaping Huang,Hyung Jin Chang,Yihua Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL4Gaze is the first large-scale benchmark (489K QA pairs across 124K images) for evaluating and training vision-language models on gaze understanding through four unified VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaze understanding is crucial for interpreting attention, intention, and social interaction in visual scenes, but current vision-language models lack systematic evaluation or training for this capability, leaving it unknown whether gaze understanding emerges from general-purpose pre-training.

Method: Introduces VL4Gaze benchmark with four complementary gaze understanding tasks formulated as unified VQA problems: (1) gaze object description, (2) gaze direction description, (3) gaze point location, and (4) ambiguous question recognition. Evaluates both commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings.

Result: Large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision. Training on VL4Gaze brings substantial and consistent improvements across all tasks, demonstrating the importance of targeted multi-task supervision.

Conclusion: Gaze understanding does not naturally emerge from general-purpose vision-language pre-training; targeted multi-task supervision through benchmarks like VL4Gaze is essential for developing this capability in VLMs.

Abstract: Human gaze provides essential cues for interpreting attention, intention, and social interaction in visual scenes, yet gaze understanding remains largely unexplored in current vision-language models (VLMs). While recent VLMs achieve strong scene-level reasoning across a range of visual tasks, there exists no benchmark that systematically evaluates or trains them for gaze interpretation, leaving open the question of whether gaze understanding can emerge from general-purpose vision-language pre-training. To address this gap, we introduce VL4Gaze, the first large-scale benchmark designed to investigate, evaluate, and unlock the potential of VLMs for gaze understanding. VL4Gaze contains 489K automatically generated question-answer pairs across 124K images and formulates gaze understanding as a unified VQA problem through four complementary tasks: (1) gaze object description, (2) gaze direction description, (3) gaze point location, and (4) ambiguous question recognition. We comprehensively evaluate both commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings. The results show that even large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision. In contrast, training on VL4Gaze brings substantial and consistent improvements across all tasks, highlighting the importance of targeted multi-task supervision for developing gaze understanding capabilities in VLMs. We will release the dataset and code to support further research and development in this direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for efficient trash detection on edge and IoT devices under strict TinyML constraints, where existing detectors are too resource-intensive for deployment on microcontrollers and other resource-constrained hardware.

Method: The proposed method uses an iterative hardware-aware neural architecture search framework that constructs a Once-for-All-style ResDets supernet and performs evolutionary search alternating between backbone and neck/head optimization, supported by population passthrough and accuracy predictors to reduce search cost.

On MAX78002 microcontroller, specialized variants reduce energy consumption by up to 88%, latency by up to 78%, and average power by up to 53% compared to existing TinyML detectors.

Conclusion: The proposed hardware-aware neural architecture search framework successfully generates scalable, deployment-ready trash detectors that significantly outperform existing solutions in accuracy, efficiency, and resource usage for TinyML applications on edge and IoT devices.

Abstract: This paper addresses trash detection on the TACO dataset under strict TinyML constraints using an iterative hardware-aware neural architecture search framework targeting edge and IoT devices. The proposed method constructs a Once-for-All-style ResDets supernet and performs iterative evolutionary search that alternates between backbone and neck/head optimization, supported by a population passthrough mechanism and an accuracy predictor to reduce search cost and improve stability. This framework yields a family of deployment-ready detectors, termed TrashDets. On a five-class TACO subset (paper, plastic, bottle, can, cigarette), the strongest variant, TrashDet-l, achieves 19.5 mAP50 with 30.5M parameters, improving accuracy by up to 3.6 mAP50 over prior detectors while using substantially fewer parameters.

### [4] [OccuFly: A 3D Vision Benchmark for Semantic Scene Completion from the Aerial Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20770)
*Markus Gross,Sai B. Matha,Aya Fahmy,Rui Song,Daniel Cremers,Henri Meess*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces OccuFly, the first real-world camera-based aerial Semantic Scene Completion benchmark for UAVs, with seasonal data at different altitudes and a LiDAR-free annotation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSC is crucial for 3D perception in robotics but has been unexplored in aerial scenarios. LiDAR-based approaches are impractical for most UAVs due to regulations, weight constraints, and sparse point clouds from elevated viewpoints.

Method: Created OccuFly benchmark with camera data from UAVs at 50m, 40m, 30m altitudes across four seasons. Developed LiDAR-free annotation framework using traditional 3D reconstruction to lift 2D masks into 3D point clouds, minimizing manual annotation effort.

Result: OccuFly covers urban, industrial, rural scenarios with 22 semantic classes. Benchmark shows challenges specific to elevated viewpoints and provides comprehensive aerial 3D scene understanding data.

Conclusion: OccuFly enables aerial SSC research without LiDAR dependency, addressing UAV-specific constraints. The benchmark facilitates holistic aerial 3D perception and highlights unique challenges of elevated viewpoints.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is crucial for 3D perception in mobile robotics, as it enables holistic scene understanding by jointly estimating dense volumetric occupancy and per-voxel semantics. Although SSC has been widely studied in terrestrial domains such as autonomous driving, aerial scenarios like autonomous flying remain largely unexplored, thereby limiting progress on downstream applications. Furthermore, LiDAR sensors represent the primary modality for SSC data generation, which poses challenges for most uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to flight regulations, mass and energy constraints, and the sparsity of LiDAR-based point clouds from elevated viewpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce OccuFly, the first real-world, camera-based aerial SSC benchmark, captured at altitudes of 50m, 40m, and 30m during spring, summer, fall, and winter. OccuFly covers urban, industrial, and rural scenarios, provides 22 semantic classes, and the data format adheres to established conventions to facilitate seamless integration with existing research. Crucially, we propose a LiDAR-free data generation framework based on camera modality, which is ubiquitous on modern UAVs. By utilizing traditional 3D reconstruction, our framework automates label transfer by lifting a subset of annotated 2D masks into the reconstructed point cloud, thereby substantially minimizing manual 3D annotation effort. Finally, we benchmark the state-of-the-art on OccuFly and highlight challenges specific to elevated viewpoints, yielding a comprehensive vision benchmark for holistic aerial 3D scene understanding.

*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NullBUS: A multimodal mixed-supervision framework for breast ultrasound segmentation that handles missing text prompts using learnable null embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many public breast ultrasound datasets lack reliable metadata or reports, constraining training to small multimodal subsets and reducing robustness of promptable segmentation methods that require text or spatial prompts.

Method: Proposes NullBUS framework that learns from images with and without prompts using nullable prompts implemented as learnable null embeddings with presence masks, enabling fallback to image-only evidence when metadata are absent while utilizing text when available.

Result: Achieves mean IoU of 0.8568 and mean Dice of 0.9103 on a unified pool of three public BUS datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance under mixed prompt availability.

Conclusion: NullBUS effectively addresses the challenge of missing metadata in public BUS datasets by enabling mixed-supervision learning, improving segmentation robustness and performance when text prompts are inconsistently available.

Abstract: Breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation provides lesion boundaries essential for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning. While promptable methods can improve segmentation performance and tumor delineation when text or spatial prompts are available, many public BUS datasets lack reliable metadata or reports, constraining training to small multimodal subsets and reducing robustness. We propose NullBUS, a multimodal mixed-supervision framework that learns from images with and without prompts in a single model. To handle missing text, we introduce nullable prompts, implemented as learnable null embeddings with presence masks, enabling fallback to image-only evidence when metadata are absent and the use of text when present. Evaluated on a unified pool of three public BUS datasets, NullBUS achieves a mean IoU of 0.8568 and a mean Dice of 0.9103, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance under mixed prompt availability.

### [6] [Learning to Sense for Driving: Joint Optics-Sensor-Model Co-Design for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20815)
*Reeshad Khan amd John Gauch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Task-driven co-design framework unifies optics, sensor modeling, and semantic segmentation into end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline, improving segmentation performance while maintaining edge deployability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autonomous driving pipelines separate camera design from perception, using fixed optics and handcrafted ISPs optimized for human viewing rather than machine perception, discarding information and forcing models to adapt to sensor artifacts.

Method: End-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline integrating realistic cellphone-scale lens models, learnable color filter arrays, Poisson-Gaussian noise processes, quantization, and lightweight semantic segmentation networks, all optimized directly for segmentation objectives.

Result: Consistent mIoU improvements on KITTI-360 over fixed pipelines, with optics modeling and CFA learning providing largest gains, especially for thin or low-light-sensitive classes. Achieved with compact ~1M-parameter model running at ~28 FPS.

Conclusion: Full-stack co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks is a principled path toward efficient, reliable, and deployable perception in autonomous systems, with co-designed sensors adapting acquisition to semantic structure.

Abstract: Traditional autonomous driving pipelines decouple camera design from downstream perception, relying on fixed optics and handcrafted ISPs that prioritize human viewable imagery rather than machine semantics. This separation discards information during demosaicing, denoising, or quantization, while forcing models to adapt to sensor artifacts. We present a task-driven co-design framework that unifies optics, sensor modeling, and lightweight semantic segmentation networks into a single end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline. Building on DeepLens[19], our system integrates realistic cellphone-scale lens models, learnable color filter arrays, Poisson-Gaussian noise processes, and quantization, all optimized directly for segmentation objectives. Evaluations on KITTI-360 show consistent mIoU improvements over fixed pipelines, with optics modeling and CFA learning providing the largest gains, especially for thin or low-light-sensitive classes. Importantly, these robustness gains are achieved with a compact ~1M-parameter model running at ~28 FPS, demonstrating edge deployability. Visual and quantitative analyses further highlight how co-designed sensors adapt acquisition to semantic structure, sharpening boundaries and maintaining accuracy under blur, noise, and low bit-depth. Together, these findings establish full-stack co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks as a principled path toward efficient, reliable, and deployable perception in autonomous systems.

*Vidit Agrawal,John Peters,Tyler N. Thompson,Mohammad Vali Sanian,Chau Pham,Nikita Moshkov,Arshad Kazi,Aditya Pillai,Jack Freeman,Byunguk Kang,Samouil L. Farhi,Ernest Fraenkel,Ron Stewart,Lassi Paavolainen,Bryan A. Plummer,Juan C. Caicedo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHAMMI-75 is a diverse, multi-channel microscopy image dataset from 75 biological studies that enables training channel-adaptive cellular morphology models for broader applicability across different microscopy types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cellular morphology models are specialized for single microscopy imaging types, limiting their reuse across biological studies due to technical mismatches (different channel numbers) or out-of-distribution experimental conditions.

Method: Created CHAMMI-75, an open access dataset curated from publicly available sources containing heterogeneous, multi-channel microscopy images from 75 diverse biological studies to train channel-adaptive models.

Result: Training with CHAMMI-75 improves performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks due to its high diversity in microscopy modalities, enabling models to process various microscopy image types.

Conclusion: CHAMMI-75 paves the way for next-generation cellular morphology models that are channel-adaptive and can be broadly applied across different biological studies and microscopy types.

Abstract: Quantifying cell morphology using images and machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool to study the response of cells to treatments. However, models used to quantify cellular morphology are typically trained with a single microscopy imaging type. This results in specialized models that cannot be reused across biological studies because the technical specifications do not match (e.g., different number of channels), or because the target experimental conditions are out of distribution. Here, we present CHAMMI-75, an open access dataset of heterogeneous, multi-channel microscopy images from 75 diverse biological studies. We curated this resource from publicly available sources to investigate cellular morphology models that are channel-adaptive and can process any microscopy image type. Our experiments show that training with CHAMMI-75 can improve performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks primarily because of its high diversity in microscopy modalities. This work paves the way to create the next generation of cellular morphology models for biological studies.

*Putu Indah Githa Cahyani,Komang David Dananjaya Suartana,Novanto Yudistira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive visual preprocessing method for VLMs that dynamically adjusts input resolution and cropping based on image content, reducing inference time by over 50% without modifying model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs face high inference latency and computational costs, especially with high-resolution inputs. Existing pipelines use static preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for simple images.

Method: Proposes adaptive visual preprocessing combining content-aware image analysis, adaptive resolution selection, and content-aware cropping to reduce visual redundancy before vision encoding. Integrated with FastVLM without architecture changes or retraining.

Result: Reduces per-image inference time by over 50%, lowers mean full generation time, and achieves >55% reduction in visual token count compared to baseline on DocVQA subset.

Conclusion: Input-aware preprocessing is an effective lightweight strategy for improving deployment efficiency of vision-language models, demonstrating significant speedups without model modifications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on multimodal reasoning tasks, but their deployment remains challenging due to high inference latency and computational cost, particularly when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While recent architectures such as FastVLM improve efficiency through optimized vision encoders, existing pipelines still rely on static visual preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for visually simple inputs. In this work, we propose an adaptive visual preprocessing method that dynamically adjusts input resolution and spatial coverage based on image content characteristics. The proposed approach combines content-aware image analysis, adaptive resolution selection, and content-aware cropping to reduce visual redundancy prior to vision encoding. Importantly, the method is integrated with FastVLM without modifying its architecture or requiring retraining. We evaluate the proposed method on a subset of the DocVQA dataset in an inference-only setting, focusing on efficiency-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that adaptive preprocessing reduces per-image inference time by over 50\%, lowers mean full generation time, and achieves a consistent reduction of more than 55\% in visual token count compared to the baseline pipeline. These findings demonstrate that input-aware preprocessing is an effective and lightweight strategy for improving deployment-oriented efficiency of vision-language models. To facilitate reproducibility, our implementation is provided as a fork of the FastVLM repository, incorporating the files for the proposed method, and is available at https://github.com/kmdavidds/mlfastlm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALIVE is a local AI system that transforms passive lecture videos into interactive learning experiences using avatar-delivered lectures, content-aware retrieval, and real-time multimodal interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional lecture videos lack real-time clarification mechanisms, forcing learners to search externally when confused. Existing interactive systems lack lecture awareness, rely on cloud services, or fail to integrate retrieval and avatar explanations in a privacy-preserving way.

Method: ALIVE operates fully on local hardware with three components: (1) Avatar-delivered lectures via ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) Content-aware retrieval combining semantic similarity with timestamp alignment; (3) Real-time multimodal interaction allowing pause, text/voice questions, and avatar/text responses.

Result: Demonstrated on a medical imaging course, ALIVE shows accurate retrieval, good latency characteristics, and positive user experience. The system provides accurate, content-aware, and engaging real-time support.

Conclusion: ALIVE shows how multimodal AI combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment can significantly enhance recorded lectures' pedagogical value, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments.

Abstract: Traditional lecture videos offer flexibility but lack mechanisms for real-time clarification, forcing learners to search externally when confusion arises. Recent advances in large language models and neural avatars provide new opportunities for interactive learning, yet existing systems typically lack lecture awareness, rely on cloud-based services, or fail to integrate retrieval and avatar-delivered explanations in a unified, privacy-preserving pipeline.
  We present ALIVE, an Avatar-Lecture Interactive Video Engine that transforms passive lecture viewing into a dynamic, real-time learning experience. ALIVE operates fully on local hardware and integrates (1) Avatar-delivered lecture generated through ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) A content-aware retrieval mechanism that combines semantic similarity with timestamp alignment to surface contextually relevant lecture segments; and (3) Real-time multimodal interaction, enabling students to pause the lecture, ask questions through text or voice, and receive grounded explanations either as text or as avatar-delivered responses.
  To maintain responsiveness, ALIVE employs lightweight embedding models, FAISS-based retrieval, and segmented avatar synthesis with progressive preloading. We demonstrate the system on a complete medical imaging course, evaluate its retrieval accuracy, latency characteristics, and user experience, and show that ALIVE provides accurate, content-aware, and engaging real-time support.
  ALIVE illustrates how multimodal AI-when combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment-can significantly enhance the pedagogical value of recorded lectures, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments.

TL;DR: Proposes 3D pipeline detection framework using multi-view GPR data with DCO-YOLO enhancements and 3D-DIoU matching for improved small-target recognition in complex underground scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses weak correlation between multi-view features, low recognition accuracy for small-scale targets, and insufficient robustness in complex scenarios for underground pipeline detection using 3D ground penetrating radar.

Method: 1) B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis with FDTD simulation validation; 2) DCO-YOLO framework integrating DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention into YOLOv11; 3) 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm with geometric constraints; 4) Three-view fusion strategy to resolve single-view ambiguities.

Conclusion: Integrates deep learning optimization with 3D GPR physical characteristics, providing efficient and reliable technical framework for intelligent underground pipeline recognition and localization.

Abstract: To address the issues of weak correlation between multi-view features, low recognition accuracy of small-scale targets, and insufficient robustness in complex scenarios in underground pipeline detection using 3D GPR, this paper proposes a 3D pipeline intelligent detection framework. First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features. This study integrates deep learning optimization strategies with the physical characteristics of 3D GPR, offering an efficient and reliable novel technical framework for the intelligent recognition and localization of underground pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRV360 enables efficient 360° video streaming by decoding only user-selected viewports instead of entire panoramic frames, achieving 7x memory reduction and 2.5x speedup over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit neural representations (NeRV) show promise for video compression but struggle with high-resolution 360° videos due to high memory usage and slow decoding, making real-time applications impractical.

Method: NeRV360 is an end-to-end framework that integrates viewport extraction into decoding, using a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on viewpoint and time, decoding only user-selected viewports.

Result: On 6K-resolution videos, NeRV360 achieves 7-fold reduction in memory consumption and 2.5-fold increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV, while delivering better image quality in objective metrics.

Conclusion: NeRV360 provides an efficient solution for 360° video streaming by selectively decoding viewports, overcoming memory and speed limitations of previous NeRV approaches for high-resolution panoramic content.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for videos (NeRV) have shown strong potential for video compression. However, applying NeRV to high-resolution 360-degree videos causes high memory usage and slow decoding, making real-time applications impractical. We propose NeRV360, an end-to-end framework that decodes only the user-selected viewport instead of reconstructing the entire panoramic frame. Unlike conventional pipelines, NeRV360 integrates viewport extraction into decoding and introduces a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on viewpoint and time. Experiments on 6K-resolution videos show that NeRV360 achieves a 7-fold reduction in memory consumption and a 2.5-fold increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV, a representative prior work, while delivering better image quality in terms of objective metrics.

### [12] [Beyond Weight Adaptation: Feature-Space Domain Injection for Cross-Modal Ship Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20892)
*Tingfeng Xian,Wenlve Zhou,Zhiheng Zhou,Zhelin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method called Domain Representation Injection (DRI) that bridges modality gaps in Cross-Modality Ship Re-Identification by injecting domain-specific representations into frozen Vision Foundation Models, achieving SOTA performance with minimal trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-Modality Ship Re-Identification faces significant modality discrepancies, and existing solutions require large-scale paired datasets for pre-training. The paper explores Vision Foundation Models to bridge modality gaps but finds existing PEFT methods suboptimal for limited-capacity models.

Method: Proposes Domain Representation Injection (DRI) - a feature-space PEFT strategy that keeps the VFM frozen while using a lightweight Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations. A Modulator adaptively transforms these representations based on contextual information, then injects them into intermediate layers via additive fusion to reshape feature distributions without altering pre-trained weights.

Result: Achieves State-of-the-Art performance with minimal trainable parameters: 57.9% and 60.5% mAP on HOSS-ReID dataset using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters respectively.

Conclusion: DRI effectively bridges modality gaps in CMS Re-ID by leveraging frozen VFMs while injecting domain-specific knowledge through feature-space optimization, offering superior performance with parameter efficiency compared to weight-space PEFT methods.

Abstract: Cross-Modality Ship Re-Identification (CMS Re-ID) is critical for achieving all-day and all-weather maritime target tracking, yet it is fundamentally challenged by significant modality discrepancies. Mainstream solutions typically rely on explicit modality alignment strategies; however, this paradigm heavily depends on constructing large-scale paired datasets for pre-training. To address this, grounded in the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we explore the potential of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in bridging modality gaps. Recognizing the suboptimal performance of existing generic Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods that operate within the weight space, particularly on limited-capacity models, we shift the optimization perspective to the feature space and propose a novel PEFT strategy termed Domain Representation Injection (DRI). Specifically, while keeping the VFM fully frozen to maximize the preservation of general knowledge, we design a lightweight, learnable Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations rich in modality and identity attributes from raw inputs. Guided by the contextual information of intermediate features at different layers, a Modulator adaptively transforms these representations. Subsequently, they are injected into the intermediate layers via additive fusion, dynamically reshaping the feature distribution to adapt to the downstream task without altering the VFM's pre-trained weights. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance with minimal trainable parameters. For instance, on the HOSS-ReID dataset, we attain 57.9\% and 60.5\% mAP using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/TingfengXian/DRI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths globally, requiring better early detection methods. Current multimodal fusion approaches for pulmonary nodule analysis are limited to inefficient vector concatenation and simple attention mechanisms, creating a need for more effective multimodal information fusion.

Also compiled NLST-cmst multimodal dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments on NLST-cmst and CSTL-derived datasets show DGSAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in pulmonary nodule classification with exceptional computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed DGSAN framework effectively addresses limitations in multimodal fusion for pulmonary nodule analysis, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency for early lung cancer detection.

Abstract: Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules are essential for improving patient survival rates. Although previous research has integrated multimodal and multi-temporal information, outperforming single modality and single time point, the fusion methods are limited to inefficient vector concatenation and simple mutual attention, highlighting the need for more effective multimodal information fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which leverages temporal variations and multimodal data to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Our methodology involves developing a Global-Local Feature Encoder to better capture the local, global, and fused characteristics of pulmonary nodules. Additionally, a Dual-Graph Construction method organizes multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module is introduced to refine feature integration. We also compiled a novel multimodal dataset named the NLST-cmst dataset as a comprehensive source of support for related research. Our extensive experiments, conducted on both the NLST-cmst and curated CSTL-derived datasets, demonstrate that our DGSAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classifying pulmonary nodules with exceptional computational efficiency.

*Zifu Zhang,Tongda Xu,Siqi Li,Shengxi Li,Yue Zhang,Mai Xu,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on compressed images, analyzes performance gaps, and proposes a universal adaptor to improve VLM performance on compressed images by 10%-30%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs primarily work with high-bitrate compressed images, but their ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images remains unexplored despite growing demand for efficient image compression in VLM applications.

Method: 1) Created a comprehensive benchmark with over 1 million compressed images using various codecs and tasks; 2) Analyzed performance gaps from information loss during compression vs. VLM generalization failure; 3) Developed a universal VLM adaptor to enhance performance on compressed images.

Result: The benchmark reveals significant performance gaps for VLMs on compressed images. The proposed universal adaptor improves VLM performance across images with varying codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%, demonstrating that only the generalization gap can be mitigated.

Conclusion: The paper provides valuable insights into VLM performance on compressed images, introduces the first comprehensive benchmark for this evaluation, and offers a practical solution (universal adaptor) that significantly improves performance, contributing to bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the growing demand for their applications, efficient compression of the image inputs has become increasingly important. Existing VLMs predominantly digest and understand high-bitrate compressed images, while their ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images has yet to be explored by far. In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the ability of VLM against compressed images, varying existing widely used image codecs and diverse set of tasks, encompassing over one million compressed images in our benchmark. Next, we analyse the source of performance gap, by categorising the gap from a) the information loss during compression and b) generalisation failure of VLM. We visualize these gaps with concrete examples and identify that for compressed images, only the generalization gap can be mitigated. Finally, we propose a universal VLM adaptor to enhance model performance on images compressed by existing codecs. Consequently, we demonstrate that a single adaptor can improve VLM performance across images with varying codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%. We believe that our benchmark and enhancement method provide valuable insights and contribute toward bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images.

*Seongmin Jung,Seongho Choi,Gunwoo Jeon,Minsu Cho,Jongwoo Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoGrounder is a novel 3D visual grounding framework that uses panoramic renderings with 3D features as intermediate representation, enabling pretrained 2D vision-language models to perform 3D scene reasoning with strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised 3D visual grounding models have limited generalization due to scarce 3D vision-language datasets and weaker reasoning capabilities compared to modern 2D vision-language models. There's a need to bridge 2D VLMs' strong reasoning with 3D scene understanding.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Places panoramic viewpoints based on scene layout/geometry, 2) Uses pretrained 2D VLMs to ground text queries on panoramic renderings augmented with 3D semantic/geometric features, 3) Fuses per-view predictions into 3D bounding boxes via lifting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks, and demonstrates superior generalization to unseen 3D datasets and text rephrasings.

Conclusion: PanoGrounder effectively bridges 2D vision-language models with 3D reasoning through panoramic representations, offering strong generalization capabilities while leveraging existing 2D VLM advancements for 3D visual grounding tasks.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) is a critical bridge from vision-language perception to robotics, requiring both language understanding and 3D scene reasoning. Traditional supervised models leverage explicit 3D geometry but exhibit limited generalization, owing to the scarcity of 3D vision-language datasets and the limited reasoning capabilities compared to modern vision-language models (VLMs). We propose PanoGrounder, a generalizable 3DVG framework that couples multi-modal panoramic representation with pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning. Panoramic renderings, augmented with 3D semantic and geometric features, serve as an intermediate representation between 2D and 3D, and offer two major benefits: (i) they can be directly fed to VLMs with minimal adaptation and (ii) they retain long-range object-to-object relations thanks to their 360-degree field of view. We devise a three-stage pipeline that places a compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering the scene layout and geometry, grounds a text query on each panoramic rendering with a VLM, and fuses per-view predictions into a single 3D bounding box via lifting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanRefer and Nr3D, and demonstrates superior generalization to unseen 3D datasets and text rephrasings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Render introduces quantile rendering for 3D Gaussian Splatting to efficiently handle high-dimensional features for open-vocabulary segmentation, achieving ~43.7x speedup while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D open-vocabulary segmentation using 3D Gaussian Splatting suffer from inefficient rendering of high-dimensional features, often requiring codebooks or feature compression that cause information loss and degrade segmentation quality.

Method: Proposes Quantile Rendering (Q-Render) that sparsely samples only dominant Gaussians along each ray instead of all intersecting ones. Also introduces Gaussian Splatting Network (GS-Net), a generalizable 3D neural network that predicts Gaussian features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ScanNet and LeRF benchmarks, enables real-time rendering with ~43.7x speedup on 512-D feature maps compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: Q-Render effectively addresses the efficiency bottleneck in high-dimensional feature rendering for 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, achieving both superior performance and significant speed improvements.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision have successfully extended Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) to the 3D domain by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Despite this progress, efficiently rendering the high-dimensional features required for open-vocabulary queries poses a significant challenge. Existing methods employ codebooks or feature compression, causing information loss, thereby degrading segmentation quality. To address this limitation, we introduce Quantile Rendering (Q-Render), a novel rendering strategy for 3D Gaussians that efficiently handles high-dimensional features while maintaining high fidelity. Unlike conventional volume rendering, which densely samples all 3D Gaussians intersecting each ray, Q-Render sparsely samples only those with dominant influence along the ray. By integrating Q-Render into a generalizable 3D neural network, we also propose Gaussian Splatting Network (GS-Net), which predicts Gaussian features in a generalizable manner. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and LeRF demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while enabling real-time rendering with an approximate ~43.7x speedup on 512-D feature maps. Code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual programming methods for 3D spatial reasoning rely on fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before problem-solving, leading to suboptimal programs and poor tool utilization.

Method: TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating solutions in an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library.

Result: TVP outperforms GPT-4o by 22% and previous visual programming systems by 11% on Omni3D-Bench. Learned tools are used 5x more frequently than inductively created ones and generalize well to unseen spatial tasks.

Conclusion: Experience-driven transductive tool creation is a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D scenes requires precise geometric calculations that challenge vision-language models. Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Amodal completion faces challenges in maintaining semantic consistency and structural integrity. Prior progressive approaches suffer from inference instability and error accumulation due to their sequential nature.

Method: Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. Includes: (1) self-correcting Verification Agent using Chain-of-Thought reasoning to correct visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders, and (2) Diverse Hypothesis Generator for multiple plausible semantic interpretations of invisible regions.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets. Also introduces MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric validated against human judgment and ground truth.

Conclusion: The proposed collaborative multi-agent reasoning framework enables visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis for amodal completion, addressing limitations of prior progressive approaches through explicit semantic planning before pixel generation.

Abstract: Amodal completion, the task of inferring invisible object parts, faces significant challenges in maintaining semantic consistency and structural integrity. Prior progressive approaches are inherently limited by inference instability and error accumulation. To tackle these limitations, we present a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. By employing specialized agents for upfront reasoning, our method generates a structured, explicit plan before pixel generation, enabling visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis. We integrate this framework with two critical mechanisms: (1) a self-correcting Verification Agent that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to rectify visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders strictly within the Semantic Planning phase, and (2) a Diverse Hypothesis Generator that addresses the ambiguity of invisible regions by offering diverse, plausible semantic interpretations, surpassing the limited pixel-level variations of standard random seed sampling. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in assessing inferred invisible content, we introduce the MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric. Validated against human judgment and ground truth, these metrics establish a robust standard for assessing structural completeness and semantic consistency with visible context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REM is a new synthetic image detection paradigm that shifts from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images, achieving 7.5% average improvement over SOTA methods and strong generalization on severely degraded real-world benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic image detectors overfit to generator-specific artifacts and are sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative architectures evolve and images undergo multi-round cross-platform sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), these artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect.

Method: Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM) introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. The approach also includes RealChain benchmark covering both open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation.

Result: Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods, and notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark.

Conclusion: REM establishes a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions by shifting from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images, with code and RealChain benchmark to be made publicly available.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has intensified the need for reliable and robust detection under real-world conditions. However, existing detectors often overfit to generator-specific artifacts and remain highly sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative architectures evolve and images undergo multi-round cross-platform sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), these artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect. To address this, we propose Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), a new paradigm that shifts detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images. REM introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. We further build RealChain, a comprehensive benchmark covering both open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation. Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods, and notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions. The code and the RealChain benchmark will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

*Yujin Noh,Inho Jake Park,Chigon Hwang*

TL;DR: SPOT is a map-guided LLM agent that predicts vehicle trajectories across CCTV blind spots in multi-camera environments without training, using spatial information and beam search to maintain continuous tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems suffer from blind spots between cameras, causing ID switching and trajectory loss, which reduces reliability of real-time path prediction in multi-camera environments.

Method: Uses map-guided LLM agent with road structures and CCTV placement represented as spatial documents. Transforms vehicle positions to world coordinates using relative position and FOV information. Combines spatial data with vehicle movement patterns and performs beam search at intersection level to predict next CCTV location.

Result: Experimental results in CARLA simulator show SPOT accurately predicts next appearing CCTV in blind spots, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.

Conclusion: SPOT successfully addresses blind spot tracking limitations in multi-CCTV environments without prior training, improving trajectory continuity and reliability through spatial prediction.

Abstract: CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems face structural limitations in continuously connecting the trajectories of the same vehicle across multiple camera environments. In particular, blind spots occur due to the intervals between CCTVs and limited Fields of View (FOV), which leads to object ID switching and trajectory loss, thereby reducing the reliability of real-time path prediction. This paper proposes SPOT (Spatial Prediction Over Trajectories), a map-guided LLM agent capable of tracking vehicles even in blind spots of multi-CCTV environments without prior training. The proposed method represents road structures (Waypoints) and CCTV placement information as documents based on 2D spatial coordinates and organizes them through chunking techniques to enable real-time querying and inference. Furthermore, it transforms the vehicle's position into the actual world coordinate system using the relative position and FOV information of objects observed in CCTV images. By combining map spatial information with the vehicle's moving direction, speed, and driving patterns, a beam search is performed at the intersection level to derive candidate CCTV locations where the vehicle is most likely to enter after the blind spot. Experimental results based on the CARLA simulator in a virtual city environment confirmed that the proposed method accurately predicts the next appearing CCTV even in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural LiDAR mapping methods either rely on dense implicit representations that underutilize geometric structure, or use voxel-guided methods that struggle with real-time performance. There's a need for an efficient framework that can handle large-scale incremental mapping while maintaining high quality.

Method: Proposes XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework combining: 1) sparse grid for geometric priors and structural guidance, 2) implicit dense grid for rich scene representation, 3) VDB structure with submap-based organization for computational efficiency, 4) distillation-based overlap alignment to ensure consistency across submaps, and 5) dynamic removal module for robustness and sampling efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach delivers superior mapping quality while overcoming efficiency limitations of voxel-guided methods, outperforming existing state-of-the-art mapping methods in both performance and real-time capability.

Conclusion: XGrid-Mapping successfully addresses the challenges of neural LiDAR mapping by combining explicit and implicit representations, enabling efficient large-scale incremental mapping with real-time performance and high quality results.

Abstract: Large-scale incremental mapping is fundamental to the development of robust and reliable autonomous systems, as it underpins incremental environmental understanding with sequential inputs for navigation and decision-making. LiDAR is widely used for this purpose due to its accuracy and robustness. Recently, neural LiDAR mapping has shown impressive performance; however, most approaches rely on dense implicit representations and underutilize geometric structure, while existing voxel-guided methods struggle to achieve real-time performance. To address these challenges, we propose XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework that jointly exploits explicit and implicit representations for efficient neural LiDAR mapping. Specifically, the strategy combines a sparse grid, providing geometric priors and structural guidance, with an implicit dense grid that enriches scene representation. By coupling the VDB structure with a submap-based organization, the framework reduces computational load and enables efficient incremental mapping on a large scale. To mitigate discontinuities across submaps, we introduce a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy, in which preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones to ensure consistency in overlapping regions. To further enhance robustness and sampling efficiency, we incorporate a dynamic removal module. Extensive experiments show that our approach delivers superior mapping quality while overcoming the efficiency limitations of voxel-guided methods, thereby outperforming existing state-of-the-art mapping methods.

Motivation: Long-tailed pulmonary anomalies in chest radiography present diagnostic challenges due to scarcity of rare lesion examples, limiting generative methods' capabilities and leaving diagnostic precision suboptimal.

Method: Proposes a data synthesis pipeline: 1) Train diffusion model on normal X-rays, 2) Use pre-trained model to inpaint head lesions into diseased X-rays while preserving tail classes as augmented data, 3) Integrate Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module with Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the data scarcity problem for rare pulmonary lesions through innovative diffusion-based data augmentation with LLM guidance, achieving state-of-the-art diagnostic performance on standard chest X-ray datasets.

Abstract: Long-tailed pulmonary anomalies in chest radiography present formidable diagnostic challenges. Despite the recent strides in diffusion-based methods for enhancing the representation of tailed lesions, the paucity of rare lesion exemplars curtails the generative capabilities of these approaches, thereby leaving the diagnostic precision less than optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel data synthesis pipeline designed to augment tail lesions utilizing a copious supply of conventional normal X-rays. Specifically, a sufficient quantity of normal samples is amassed to train a diffusion model capable of generating normal X-ray images. This pre-trained diffusion model is subsequently utilized to inpaint the head lesions present in the diseased X-rays, thereby preserving the tail classes as augmented training data. Additionally, we propose the integration of a Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module alongside a Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize the inpainting fine-tuning process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the public lung datasets MIMIC and CheXpert demonstrate that the proposed method sets a new benchmark in performance.

Method: PUFM++ introduces a two-stage flow-matching strategy: first learning direct straight-path flow from sparse inputs to dense targets, then refining with noise-perturbed samples. It includes a data-driven adaptive time scheduler for efficient sampling, on-manifold constraints during sampling to keep points aligned with surfaces, and a recurrent interface network (RIN) for hierarchical feature interactions.

Conclusion: PUFM++ presents an effective enhanced flow-matching framework that advances point cloud upsampling capabilities, with publicly available code and pretrained models demonstrating practical utility for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have demonstrated strong promise for high-quality point cloud upsampling. In this work, we present PUFM++, an enhanced flow-matching framework for reconstructing dense and accurate point clouds from sparse, noisy, and partial observations. PUFM++ improves flow matching along three key axes: (i) geometric fidelity, (ii) robustness to imperfect input, and (iii) consistency with downstream surface-based tasks. We introduce a two-stage flow-matching strategy that first learns a direct, straight-path flow from sparse inputs to dense targets, and then refines it using noise-perturbed samples to approximate the terminal marginal distribution better. To accelerate and stabilize inference, we propose a data-driven adaptive time scheduler that improves sampling efficiency based on interpolation behavior. We further impose on-manifold constraints during sampling to ensure that generated points remain aligned with the underlying surface. Finally, we incorporate a recurrent interface network~(RIN) to strengthen hierarchical feature interactions and boost reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: A feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that predicts scene properties from RGB image sequences using cross-view attention, with consistency-based fine-tuning for real-world generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-view approaches ignore cross-view relationships, causing inconsistent results, while multi-view optimization methods are computationally expensive and don't scale well. There's also a generalization gap between synthetic training data and real-world scenes.

Method: Feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework using alternating attention across views to capture intra-view lighting interactions and inter-view material consistency. Includes consistency-based fine-tuning strategy using unlabeled real-world videos to enhance multi-view coherence and robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets in terms of multi-view consistency, material and normal estimation quality, and generalization to real-world imagery.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by providing computationally efficient feed-forward inference while maintaining multi-view consistency and improving real-world generalization through consistency-based fine-tuning.

Abstract: Multi-view inverse rendering aims to recover geometry, materials, and illumination consistently across multiple viewpoints. When applied to multi-view images, existing single-view approaches often ignore cross-view relationships, leading to inconsistent results. In contrast, multi-view optimization methods rely on slow differentiable rendering and per-scene refinement, making them computationally expensive and hard to scale. To address these limitations, we introduce a feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that directly predicts spatially varying albedo, metallic, roughness, diffuse shading, and surface normals from sequences of RGB images. By alternating attention across views, our model captures both intra-view long-range lighting interactions and inter-view material consistency, enabling coherent scene-level reasoning within a single forward pass. Due to the scarcity of real-world training data, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often struggle to generalize to real-world scenes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a consistency-based finetuning strategy that leverages unlabeled real-world videos to enhance both multi-view coherence and robustness under in-the-wild conditions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of multi-view consistency, material and normal estimation quality, and generalization to real-world imagery.

Motivation: Current visual generative pretraining methods rely on BERT-style masked modeling that ignores temporal information crucial for video analysis. Existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods suffer from inaccurate semantic localization, poor generation quality, and poor semantics.

Method: Proposes NExT-Vid with two key components: 1) context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from target decoding, and 2) conditioned flow-matching decoder to enhance generation quality and diversity. Uses masked next-frame prediction for joint image-video modeling.

Conclusion: NExT-Vid achieves strong representations through context-isolated flow-matching pretraining, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and advancing autoregressive visual generative pretraining.

Abstract: Recent advances in pretraining general foundation models have significantly improved performance across diverse downstream tasks. While autoregressive (AR) generative models like GPT have revolutionized NLP, most visual generative pretraining methods still rely on BERT-style masked modeling, which often disregards the temporal information essential for video analysis. The few existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods suffer from issues such as inaccurate semantic localization and poor generation quality, leading to poor semantics. In this work, we propose NExT-Vid, a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework that utilizes masked next-frame prediction to jointly model images and videos. NExT-Vid introduces a context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from target decoding, and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to enhance generation quality and diversity. Through context-isolated flow-matching pretraining, our approach achieves strong representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale pretrained models demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms previous generative pretraining methods for visual representation learning via attentive probing in downstream classification.

TL;DR: GBGM is a structure-aware data augmentation method that uses granular-ball computing to preserve semantically important regions while masking redundant areas, improving model robustness without requiring labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models overfit with limited data and distribution shifts; existing mask-based augmentation lacks structural awareness and may discard essential semantic information.

Method: Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM) uses Granular-ball Computing to adaptively preserve semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas through coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent improvements in classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness and broad applicability.

Conclusion: GBGM provides a simple, model-agnostic structure-aware augmentation paradigm that integrates seamlessly with CNNs and Vision Transformers, enhancing model robustness.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, but they still rely heavily on large-scale labeled data and tend to overfit when data are limited or distributions shift. Data augmentation, particularly mask-based information dropping, can enhance robustness by forcing models to explore complementary cues; however, existing approaches often lack structural awareness and may discard essential semantics. We propose Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM), a structure-aware augmentation strategy guided by Granular-ball Computing (GBC).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods using adapted text-to-image diffusion models suffer from temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads, making efficient and consistent video editing challenging.

Method: Integrates Mamba's linear time-series module into pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing temporal attention layers. Uses low-rank approximation matrices for query/key weights and weighted averaging during training to update attention scores.

Result: Demonstrates promising results in editing various attributes, subjects, and locations in real-world videos while maintaining temporal consistency and reducing computational burden.

Conclusion: FluencyVE provides an effective one-shot video editing approach that preserves text-to-image model capabilities while addressing temporal inconsistency and computational efficiency challenges.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation and editing. However, extending this success to video editing remains challenging. Recent video editing efforts have adapted pretrained text-to-image models by adding temporal attention mechanisms to handle video tasks. Unfortunately, these methods continue to suffer from temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads. In this study, we propose FluencyVE, which is a simple yet effective one-shot video editing approach. FluencyVE integrates the linear time-series module, Mamba, into a video editing model based on pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing the temporal attention layer. This enables global frame-level attention while reducing the computational costs. In addition, we employ low-rank approximation matrices to replace the query and key weight matrices in the causal attention, and use a weighted averaging technique during training to update the attention scores. This approach significantly preserves the generative power of the text-to-image model while effectively reducing the computational burden. Experiments and analyses demonstrate promising results in editing various attributes, subjects, and locations in real-world videos.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient and effective solution for protecting portrait videos against 3D-field talking face generation attacks, addressing privacy concerns while maintaining video quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D-field video-referenced Talking Face Generation (TFG) methods synthesize high-fidelity personalized talking-face videos in real time by modeling 3D geometry and appearance from reference portrait video. This capability raises significant privacy concerns regarding malicious misuse of personal portraits. However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality. Specifically, our method introduces: (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits strong defense capability and achieves a 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high fidelity. Moreover, it remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, and the effectiveness of our design choices is further validated through ablation studies.

TL;DR: Novel latent diffusion model for infrared-to-visible face recognition with multi-attribute classifier and Self-attn Mamba module achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional facial recognition models trained on visible light datasets perform poorly on infrared images due to domain shifts. Existing infrared face recognition methods are ineffective, and current heterogeneous face recognition approaches suffer from distortion and feature loss during infrared-to-visible image conversion.

Method: Proposes a latent diffusion-based model for generating high-quality visible face images from thermal inputs. Incorporates a multi-attribute classifier to extract key facial attributes from visible images to mitigate feature loss. Introduces Self-attn Mamba module for enhanced global modeling of cross-modal features and improved inference speed.

Result: Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both image quality and identity preservation, with significant improvements in inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses challenges in heterogeneous face recognition by generating high-quality visible images from infrared inputs while preserving critical identity features, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Modern surveillance systems increasingly rely on multi-wavelength sensors and deep neural networks to recognize faces in infrared images captured at night. However, most facial recognition models are trained on visible light datasets, leading to substantial performance degradation on infrared inputs due to significant domain shifts. Early feature-based methods for infrared face recognition proved ineffective, prompting researchers to adopt generative approaches that convert infrared images into visible light images for improved recognition. This paradigm, known as Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), faces challenges such as model and modality discrepancies, leading to distortion and feature loss in generated images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel latent diffusion-based model designed to generate high-quality visible face images from thermal inputs while preserving critical identity features. A multi-attribute classifier is incorporated to extract key facial attributes from visible images, mitigating feature loss during infrared-to-visible image restoration. Additionally, we propose the Self-attn Mamba module, which enhances global modeling of cross-modal features and significantly improves inference speed. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both image quality and identity preservation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the fundamental challenge in self-supervised real-world image denoising: the antagonistic trade-off between decorrelating spatially structured noise and preserving high-frequency details that plagues existing blind-spot network methods.

Method: Introduces Next-Scale Prediction (NSP), a novel paradigm that constructs cross-scale training pairs where blind-spot networks take low-resolution, fully decorrelated sub-images as input to predict high-resolution targets that retain fine details, naturally supporting super-resolution of noisy images without retraining.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising performance on real-world benchmarks, significantly alleviating the long-standing conflict between noise decorrelation and detail preservation.

Conclusion: NSP successfully addresses the fundamental trade-off in self-supervised denoising by decoupling noise decorrelation from detail preservation, achieving superior performance while naturally enabling super-resolution capabilities.

Abstract: Self-supervised real-world image denoising remains a fundamental challenge, arising from the antagonistic trade-off between decorrelating spatially structured noise and preserving high-frequency details. Existing blind-spot network (BSN) methods rely on pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) to decorrelate noise, but aggressive downsampling fragments fine structures, while milder downsampling fails to remove correlated noise. To address this, we introduce Next-Scale Prediction (NSP), a novel self-supervised paradigm that decouples noise decorrelation from detail preservation. NSP constructs cross-scale training pairs, where BSN takes low-resolution, fully decorrelated sub-images as input to predict high-resolution targets that retain fine details. As a by-product, NSP naturally supports super-resolution of noisy images without retraining or modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSP achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising performance on real-world benchmarks, significantly alleviating the long-standing conflict between noise decorrelation and detail preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nuclear norm as convex surrogate for rank minimization in LRMC leads to suboptimal solutions due to excessive shrinkage of singular values, requiring better nonconvex approximations.

Method: Introduces reweighted logarithmic norm as nonconvex surrogate for rank function, solves optimization using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

Result: Experimental results on image inpainting show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art LRMC methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed reweighted logarithmic norm provides better approximation to rank function than existing alternatives, enabling more effective low-rank matrix completion.

Abstract: Low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) has demonstrated remarkable success in a wide range of applications. To address the NP-hard nature of the rank minimization problem, the nuclear norm is commonly used as a convex and computationally tractable surrogate for the rank function. However, this approach often yields suboptimal solutions due to the excessive shrinkage of singular values. In this letter, we propose a novel reweighted logarithmic norm as a more effective nonconvex surrogate, which provides a closer approximation than many existing alternatives. We efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem by employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results on image inpainting demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art LRMC approaches, both in terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cameras struggle with motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions for object pose tracking. Event cameras offer high dynamic range and low latency advantages to address these challenges.

Method: Uses optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking with event camera. First employs 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction to detect corners and edges from events and object models. Then searches for optical flow of corners by maximizing event-associated probability within spatio-temporal window, establishing correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Finally minimizes distances between corners and edges to iteratively optimize 6DoF object pose.

Result: Experimental results on both simulated and real events demonstrate that the method outperforms event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed optical flow-guided event camera method effectively addresses limitations of traditional cameras for object pose tracking, achieving superior performance through hybrid feature extraction and optical flow correlation.

Abstract: Object pose tracking is one of the pivotal technologies in multimedia, attracting ever-growing attention in recent years. Existing methods employing traditional cameras encounter numerous challenges such as motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions. The emerging bio-inspired sensors, particularly event cameras, possess advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, which hold the potential to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking. Experimental results of both simulated and real events demonstrate that our methods outperform event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DexAvatar is a framework for reconstructing accurate 3D hand and body poses from monocular sign language videos using learned priors, achieving 35.11% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sign language generation relies on data-driven methods needing precise 3D pose data, but most datasets only have 2D keypoints from videos. Existing 3D pose estimation from sign language videos suffers from self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur, resulting in poor reconstruction quality.

Method: DexAvatar uses learned 3D hand and body priors to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos.

Result: Achieves strong performance on the SGNify motion capture dataset, improving body and hand pose estimation by 35.11% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DexAvatar provides a novel solution for accurate 3D pose reconstruction from sign language videos, addressing limitations of current methods and enabling better data for sign language generation systems.

Abstract: The trend in sign language generation is centered around data-driven generative methods that require vast amounts of precise 2D and 3D human pose data to achieve an acceptable generation quality. However, currently, most sign language datasets are video-based and limited to automatically reconstructed 2D human poses (i.e., keypoints) and lack accurate 3D information. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors. DexAvatar achieves strong performance in the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only benchmark available for this task, reaching an improvement of 35.11% in the estimation of body and hand poses compared to the state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPath is a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that addresses three key challenges in computational pathology: data scarcity, lack of fine-grained semantic control, and terminological heterogeneity, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 51% better Patho-FID than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational pathology has a disconnect between advanced diagnostic understanding models and primitive pixel-level generative models. Three main challenges hinder progress: 1) scarcity of large, high-quality image-text datasets, 2) lack of precise semantic control forcing reliance on non-semantic cues, and 3) terminological heterogeneity where different phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning.

Method: UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control with three streams: 1) Raw-Text stream, 2) High-Level Semantics stream using learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles, and 3) Prototype stream for component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. The framework leverages mature diagnostic understanding models and addresses data scarcity by curating a 2.65M image-text corpus with a 68K finely annotated subset.

Result: UniPath achieves state-of-the-art performance with a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best method) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of real-image quality. The framework demonstrates superior performance through a comprehensive four-tier evaluation hierarchy specifically tailored to pathology.

Conclusion: UniPath successfully bridges the gap between understanding and generation in computational pathology by leveraging diagnostic semantics for controllable image generation. The framework addresses key challenges in the field and achieves significant performance improvements. The authors will release curated datasets, source code, and pre-trained model weights to advance research in this domain.

Abstract: In computational pathology, understanding and generation have evolved along disparate paths: advanced understanding models already exhibit diagnostic-level competence, whereas generative models largely simulate pixels. Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image. The meticulously curated datasets, complete source code, and pre-trained model weights developed in this study will be made openly accessible to the public.

Conclusion: The proposed Decomposition and Composition framework successfully addresses the efficiency-effectiveness dilemma in multimodal action understanding by leveraging self-supervised learning to maintain computational efficiency while achieving strong performance.

Abstract: Multimodal human action understanding is a significant problem in computer vision, with the central challenge being the effective utilization of the complementarity among diverse modalities while maintaining model efficiency. However, most existing methods rely on simple late fusion to enhance performance, which results in substantial computational overhead. Although early fusion with a shared backbone for all modalities is efficient, it struggles to achieve excellent performance. To address the dilemma of balancing efficiency and effectiveness, we introduce a self-supervised multimodal skeleton-based action representation learning framework, named Decomposition and Composition. The Decomposition strategy meticulously decomposes the fused multimodal features into distinct unimodal features, subsequently aligning them with their respective ground truth unimodal counterparts. On the other hand, the Composition strategy integrates multiple unimodal features, leveraging them as self-supervised guidance to enhance the learning of multimodal representations. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate that the proposed method strikes an excellent balance between computational cost and model performance.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has been traditionally formulated as a single-image retrieval task. Using multiple views offers clear advantages, yet this setting remains relatively underexplored and existing methods often struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this work we introduce UniPR-3D, the first VPR architecture that effectively integrates information from multiple views. UniPR-3D builds on a VGGT backbone capable of encoding multi-view 3D representations, which we adapt by designing feature aggregators and fine-tune for the place recognition task. To construct our descriptor, we jointly leverage the 3D tokens and intermediate 2D tokens produced by VGGT. Based on their distinct characteristics, we design dedicated aggregation modules for 2D and 3D features, allowing our descriptor to capture fine-grained texture cues while also reasoning across viewpoints. To further enhance generalization, we incorporate both single- and multi-frame aggregation schemes, along with a variable-length sequence retrieval strategy. Our experiments show that UniPR-3D sets a new state of the art, outperforming both single- and multi-view baselines and highlighting the effectiveness of geometry-grounded tokens for VPR.

Conclusion: T2AV-Compass serves as a challenging diagnostic testbed highlighting significant improvement room for future T2AV models and advancing text-to-audio-video generation.

Abstract: Text-to-Audio-Video (T2AV) generation aims to synthesize temporally coherent video and semantically synchronized audio from natural language, yet its evaluation remains fragmented, often relying on unimodal metrics or narrowly scoped benchmarks that fail to capture cross-modal alignment, instruction following, and perceptual realism under complex prompts. To address this limitation, we present T2AV-Compass, a unified benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of T2AV systems, consisting of 500 diverse and complex prompts constructed via a taxonomy-driven pipeline to ensure semantic richness and physical plausibility. Besides, T2AV-Compass introduces a dual-level evaluation framework that integrates objective signal-level metrics for video quality, audio quality, and cross-modal alignment with a subjective MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol for instruction following and realism assessment. Extensive evaluation of 11 representative T2AVsystems reveals that even the strongest models fall substantially short of human-level realism and cross-modal consistency, with persistent failures in audio realism, fine-grained synchronization, instruction following, etc. These results indicate significant improvement room for future models and highlight the value of T2AV-Compass as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing text-to-audio-video generation.

Conclusion: The proposed UniRec-0.1B successfully addresses the computational efficiency problem in unified document recognition while maintaining high performance through hierarchical supervision and semantic-decoupled tokenization, validated by comprehensive benchmarks.

Abstract: Text and formulas constitute the core informational components of many documents. Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

### [41] [FreeInpaint: Tuning-free Prompt Alignment and Visual Rationality Enhancement in Image Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21104)
*Chao Gong,Dong Li,Yingwei Pan,Jingjing Chen,Ting Yao,Tao Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeInpaint is a tuning-free plug-and-play method that optimizes diffusion latents during inference to improve text-guided image inpainting by enhancing prompt alignment and visual rationality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided image inpainting methods struggle to simultaneously maintain both prompt alignment (faithfulness to user text) and visual rationality (visual fidelity) when using pre-trained diffusion models.

Method: Two key techniques: 1) Prior-guided noise optimization that steers model attention to valid inpainting regions by optimizing initial noise, and 2) Composite guidance objective that directs the denoising process by optimizing intermediate latents at each step for better prompt alignment and visual rationality.

Result: Extensive experiments with various inpainting diffusion models and evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of FreeInpaint in improving text-guided image inpainting results.

Conclusion: FreeInpaint provides a practical tuning-free solution that directly optimizes diffusion latents during inference to achieve better prompt alignment and visual rationality in text-guided image inpainting tasks.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting endeavors to generate new content within specified regions of images using textual prompts from users. The primary challenge is to accurately align the inpainted areas with the user-provided prompts while maintaining a high degree of visual fidelity. While existing inpainting methods have produced visually convincing results by leveraging the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, they still struggle to uphold both prompt alignment and visual rationality simultaneously. In this work, we introduce FreeInpaint, a plug-and-play tuning-free approach that directly optimizes the diffusion latents on the fly during inference to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Technically, we introduce a prior-guided noise optimization method that steers model attention towards valid inpainting regions by optimizing the initial noise. Furthermore, we meticulously design a composite guidance objective tailored specifically for the inpainting task. This objective efficiently directs the denoising process, enhancing prompt alignment and visual rationality by optimizing intermediate latents at each step. Through extensive experiments involving various inpainting diffusion models and evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed FreeInpaint.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MarineEval, the first large-scale marine vision-language model benchmark with 2,000 image-based QA pairs, revealing that existing VLMs struggle with domain-specific marine questions despite their general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether existing vision-language models (VLMs) can act as domain experts for marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special challenges that general-purpose VLMs may not handle effectively.

Method: Constructed MarineEval dataset with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs covering 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions, with domain requirements integrated and verified by marine experts. Benchmarking 17 existing VLMs on this dataset.

Result: Experimental results show existing VLMs cannot effectively answer domain-specific marine questions, indicating significant room for performance improvement in specialized domains.

Conclusion: The MarineEval benchmark reveals limitations of current VLMs in domain-specific applications and provides a foundation for future research to improve VLM performance in specialized domains like marine science.

Abstract: We have witnessed promising progress led by large language models (LLMs) and further vision language models (VLMs) in handling various queries as a general-purpose assistant. VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research. Project Page: http://marineeval.hkustvgd.com/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGC-Net is a CLIP-based framework for text-guided medical segmentation that addresses CLIP's limitations in medical imaging through parameter-efficient adaptations, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided medical segmentation methods rely on unaligned image and text encoders requiring complex fusion modules. While CLIP provides pre-aligned multimodal features, it has three main limitations for medical imaging: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment.

Method: TGC-Net incorporates three key components: 1) Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, 2) Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and 3) Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space.

Result: Experiments on five datasets across chest X-ray and thoracic CT modalities demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer trainable parameters, including notable Dice gains on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: TGC-Net effectively addresses CLIP's limitations for medical segmentation through parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations, providing a robust framework for text-guided medical segmentation with improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Text-guided medical segmentation enhances segmentation accuracy by utilizing clinical reports as auxiliary information. However, existing methods typically rely on unaligned image and text encoders, which necessitate complex interaction modules for multimodal fusion. While CLIP provides a pre-aligned multimodal feature space, its direct application to medical imaging is limited by three main issues: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment. To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space.

To address this gap, we present ORCA, a multi-modal benchmark for marine research comprising 14,647 images from 478 species, with 42,217 bounding box annotations and 22,321 expert-verified instance captions. The dataset provides fine-grained visual and textual annotations that capture morphology-oriented attributes across diverse marine species. To catalyze methodological advances, we evaluate 18 state-of-the-art models on three tasks: object detection (closed-set and open-vocabulary), instance captioning, and visual grounding. Results highlight key challenges, including species diversity, morphological overlap, and specialized domain demands, underscoring the difficulty of marine understanding. ORCA thus establishes a comprehensive benchmark to advance research in marine domain. Project Page: http://orca.hkustvgd.com/.

### [45] [A Turn Toward Better Alignment: Few-Shot Generative Adaptation with Equivariant Feature Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21174)
*Chenghao Xu,Qi Liu,Jiexi Yan,Muli Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EFR (Equivariant Feature Rotation) is a novel few-shot image generation method that aligns source and target domains in a self-rotated proxy feature space using learnable rotation matrices from a parameterized Lie Group, enabling effective knowledge transfer without distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot image generation approaches use consistency constraints that often fail: strict constraints amplify domain gap effects causing distorted content, while relaxed constraints underutilize the source domain. The scarcity of target samples and inherent distribution discrepancies between domains further hinder effective adaptation.

Method: Proposes Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR) that aligns domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. Uses adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform source and target features into an equivariant proxy space where alignment occurs. Learnable rotation matrices preserve intra-domain structural information without distortion while facilitating knowledge transfer.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on various commonly used datasets demonstrate that the method significantly enhances generative performance within the targeted domain compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: EFR effectively addresses limitations of existing few-shot image generation methods by introducing a novel adaptation strategy that bridges domain gaps through equivariant feature rotation, enabling better knowledge transfer from source to target domains without distortion.

Abstract: Few-shot image generation aims to effectively adapt a source generative model to a target domain using very few training images. Most existing approaches introduce consistency constraints-typically through instance-level or distribution-level loss functions-to directly align the distribution patterns of source and target domains within their respective latent spaces. However, these strategies often fall short: overly strict constraints can amplify the negative effects of the domain gap, leading to distorted or uninformative content, while overly relaxed constraints may fail to leverage the source domain effectively. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent discrepancy in the underlying distribution structures of the source and target domains. The scarcity of target samples further compounds this issue by hindering accurate estimation of the target domain's distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), a novel adaptation strategy that aligns source and target domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. Specifically, we perform adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform both source and target features into an equivariant proxy space, where alignment is conducted. These learnable rotation matrices serve to bridge the domain gap by preserving intra-domain structural information without distortion, while the alignment optimization facilitates effective knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of commonly used datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the generative performance within the targeted domain.

TL;DR: NAME framework uses implicit neural representations with hierarchical temporal encoding and parametric Fourier activation to create continuous human motion representations for arbitrary frame rate interpolation/extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical motions are continuous, and higher frame rates improve smoothness and temporal coherence. Current methods lack ability to handle arbitrary frame rates for motion sequences.

Method: Proposes NAME framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) with hierarchical temporal encoding to capture multi-scale temporal patterns, and parametric activation function using Fourier transformations in MLP decoder.

Result: Extensive evaluations across benchmark datasets demonstrate effectiveness and robustness in representing complex motion behaviors with high accuracy.

Conclusion: First continuous representation framework for human motion sequences enabling arbitrary frame rate interpolation, inbetweening, and extrapolation with improved expressiveness through parametric activation.

Abstract: Physical motions are inherently continuous, and higher camera frame rates typically contribute to improved smoothness and temporal coherence. For the first time, we explore continuous representations of human motion sequences, featuring the ability to interpolate, inbetween, and even extrapolate any input motion sequences at arbitrary frame rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel parametric activation-induced hierarchical implicit representation framework, referred to as NAME, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Our method introduces a hierarchical temporal encoding mechanism that extracts features from motion sequences at multiple temporal scales, enabling effective capture of intricate temporal patterns. Additionally, we integrate a custom parametric activation function, powered by Fourier transformations, into the MLP-based decoder to enhance the expressiveness of the continuous representation. This parametric formulation significantly augments the model's ability to represent complex motion behaviors with high accuracy. Extensive evaluations across several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach.

TL;DR: VisRes Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating visual reasoning in VLMs without language supervision, revealing significant limitations in perceptual and relational reasoning across three complexity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear extent to which Vision-Language Models perform genuine visual reasoning versus relying on linguistic priors, and to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision.

Method: Introduces VisRes Bench with three complexity levels: Level 1 tests perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations (blur, texture changes, occlusion, rotation); Level 2 tests rule-based inference over single attributes (color, count, orientation); Level 3 targets compositional reasoning requiring integration of multiple visual attributes. Evaluates across 19,000+ controlled task images.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition. Clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities are uncovered across all three complexity levels.

Conclusion: VisRes provides a unified framework for advancing abstract visual reasoning in multimodal research, highlighting the need for improved visual reasoning capabilities beyond current pattern recognition approaches in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. Yet, the extent to which these models perform visual reasoning as opposed to relying on linguistic priors remains unclear. To address this, we introduce VisRes Bench, a benchmark designed to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision. Analyzing model behavior across three levels of complexity, we uncover clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities. VisRes isolates distinct reasoning abilities across its levels. Level 1 probes perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations such as blur, texture changes, occlusion, and rotation; Level 2 tests rule-based inference over a single attribute (e.g., color, count, orientation); and Level 3 targets compositional reasoning that requires integrating multiple visual attributes. Across more than 19,000 controlled task images, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition. We conclude by discussing how VisRes provides a unified framework for advancing abstract visual reasoning in multimodal research.

Motivation: Existing on-body motion estimation methods have poor wearability, expensive hardware, and cumbersome calibration, hindering adoption in daily life applications like XR interaction.

Method: Multimodal teacher-student framework integrating visual cues from egocentric cameras (forward-facing and two downward-facing) with inertial signals from consumer devices, trained on real-world Ego-Elec dataset rather than synthetic data.

Conclusion: EveryWear provides a practical, lightweight solution for human motion capture using everyday wearables, eliminating sim-to-real gap through real-world training and enabling broader adoption in daily applications.

Abstract: While on-body device-based human motion estimation is crucial for applications such as XR interaction, existing methods often suffer from poor wearability, expensive hardware, and cumbersome calibration, which hinder their adoption in daily life. To address these challenges, we present EveryWear, a lightweight and practical human motion capture approach based entirely on everyday wearables: a smartphone, smartwatch, earbuds, and smart glasses equipped with one forward-facing and two downward-facing cameras, requiring no explicit calibration before use. We introduce Ego-Elec, a 9-hour real-world dataset covering 56 daily activities across 17 diverse indoor and outdoor environments, with ground-truth 3D annotations provided by the motion capture (MoCap), to facilitate robust research and benchmarking in this direction. Our approach employs a multimodal teacher-student framework that integrates visual cues from egocentric cameras with inertial signals from consumer devices. By training directly on real-world data rather than synthetic data, our model effectively eliminates the sim-to-real gap that constrains prior work. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models, validating its effectiveness for practical full-body motion estimation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a task-agnostic method for training Large Multimodal Models to discover and use visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision, enabling better handling of vision-centric reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs are text-centric and struggle with visual reasoning tasks. Existing approaches use supervised intermediate visual steps with helper images, depth maps, or crops, but these impose restrictive priors, add annotation costs, and lack generalization.

Method: Proposes a task-agnostic mechanism that trains LMMs to discover and use visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision. These tokens attend globally and re-encode images in a task-adaptive way, allowing models to extract relevant visual information without hand-crafted supervision.

Result: The approach outperforms direct fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on diverse vision-centric tasks, including those where intermediate abstractions are hard to specify. It also generalizes well to multi-task instruction tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised visual reasoning token discovery method effectively addresses limitations of text-centric LMMs, enabling better performance on visual reasoning tasks without the need for costly annotations or restrictive priors.

Abstract: While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant progress, they remain largely text-centric, relying on language as their core reasoning modality. As a result, they are limited in their ability to handle reasoning tasks that are predominantly visual. Recent approaches have sought to address this by supervising intermediate visual steps with helper images, depth maps, or image crops. However, these strategies impose restrictive priors on what "useful" visual abstractions look like, add heavy annotation costs, and struggle to generalize across tasks. To address this critical limitation, we propose a task-agnostic mechanism that trains LMMs to discover and use visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision. These tokens attend globally and re-encode the image in a task-adaptive way, enabling the model to extract relevant visual information without hand-crafted supervision. Our approach outperforms direct fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on a diverse range of vision-centric tasks -- including those where intermediate abstractions are hard to specify -- while also generalizing to multi-task instruction tuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image-text retrieval faces challenges with vague/context-dependent queries, linguistic variability, and scalability needs. Existing methods struggle with complex real-world scenarios requiring temporal and contextual understanding.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) BM25-based candidate filtering using event-centric entity extraction to capture temporal/contextual signals, 2) BEiT-3 models for deep multimodal semantic reranking of filtered results.

Result: Achieves mean average precision of 0.559 on OpenEvents v1 benchmark, substantially outperforming prior baselines, demonstrating effectiveness for complex real-world retrieval scenarios.

Conclusion: Combining event-guided filtering with long-text vision-language modeling enables accurate and efficient image-text retrieval in complex real-world applications, with lightweight architecture suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Retrieving images from natural language descriptions is a core task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications in search engines, media archiving, and digital content management. However, real-world image-text retrieval remains challenging due to vague or context-dependent queries, linguistic variability, and the need for scalable solutions. In this work, we propose a lightweight two-stage retrieval pipeline that leverages event-centric entity extraction to incorporate temporal and contextual signals from real-world captions. The first stage performs efficient candidate filtering using BM25 based on salient entities, while the second stage applies BEiT-3 models to capture deep multimodal semantics and rerank the results. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 benchmark, our method achieves a mean average precision of 0.559, substantially outperforming prior baselines.

TL;DR: SegMo: A segment-aligned framework for generating 3D human motions from text by aligning atomic action phrases with corresponding motion segments for finer-grained text-motion correspondence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods align text with motion at the sequence level, ignoring internal semantic structure. Both motion descriptions and sequences can be decomposed into smaller semantically coherent segments, which can serve as atomic alignment units for finer-grained correspondence.

Method: Three-module framework: (1) Text Segment Extraction - decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases representing atomic actions; (2) Motion Segment Extraction - partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment - aligns text and motion segments with contrastive learning.

Result: SegMo improves the strong baseline on two widely used datasets, achieving an improved TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set. The learned shared embedding space enables application to retrieval-style tasks like motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.

Conclusion: SegMo successfully achieves fine-grained text-motion alignment by decomposing both modalities into semantically coherent segments, outperforming sequence-level alignment methods and enabling additional retrieval applications through the learned shared embedding space.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from textual descriptions is an important research problem with broad applications in video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Recent methods align the textual description with human motion at the sequence level, neglecting the internal semantic structure of modalities. However, both motion descriptions and motion sequences can be naturally decomposed into smaller and semantically coherent segments, which can serve as atomic alignment units to achieve finer-grained correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose SegMo, a novel Segment-aligned text-conditioned human Motion generation framework to achieve fine-grained text-motion alignment. Our framework consists of three modules: (1) Text Segment Extraction, which decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases, each representing a simple atomic action; (2) Motion Segment Extraction, which partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; and (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment, which aligns text and motion segments with contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegMo improves the strong baseline on two widely used datasets, achieving an improved TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set. Moreover, thanks to the learned shared embedding space for text and motion segments, SegMo can also be applied to retrieval-style tasks such as motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-shot filmmaking is aesthetically sophisticated but costly and constrained in reality. Existing video generation models rely on naive clip concatenation that fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence.

Method: Three-pronged approach: (1) Lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism in DiT architecture with Adaptive Tuning for arbitrary-frame control; (2) High-quality dataset curation with Visual Expression SFT and Tailored DPO for subject motion rationality and transition smoothness; (3) Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference for memory-efficient long sequence generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, enabling transformation of fragmented materials into cohesive cinematic experiences.

Conclusion: DreaMontage provides a comprehensive framework for generating high-quality one-shot videos from diverse user inputs, addressing key challenges in visual smoothness, temporal coherence, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The "one-shot" technique represents a distinct and sophisticated aesthetic in filmmaking. However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, empowering users to transform fragmented visual materials into vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences.

TL;DR: Unified Any-Modality AD framework for brain MRI anomaly detection that works with arbitrary modality combinations without retraining, using feature alignment and normal pattern reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical brain MRI anomaly detection faces challenges due to scarce annotated abnormal cases and frequent missing imaging modalities in real workflows. Existing models lack flexibility for unseen modality combinations and require repetitive training.

Method: Dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with feature distribution alignment to statistically align incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations. Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and INP-guided decoder reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while amplifying abnormal deviations. Randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training.

Result: Superior performance across 7 modality combinations on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks datasets, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art industrial and medical AD baselines with superior generalization.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable paradigm for multimodal medical anomaly detection under real-world, imperfect modality conditions, enabling robust anomaly detection and localization with arbitrary MRI modality availability without retraining.

Abstract: Reliable anomaly detection in brain MRI remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated abnormal cases and the frequent absence of key imaging modalities in real clinical workflows. Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art industrial and medical AD baselines across 7 modality combinations, achieving superior generalization. This study establishes a scalable paradigm for multimodal medical AD under real-world, imperfect modality conditions. Our source code is available at https://github.com/wuchangw/AnyAD.

*Weiqi Li,Zehao Zhang,Liang Lin,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACD is a novel framework for direct conditional control in video diffusion models using attention supervision, achieving better alignment with conditioning signals while maintaining temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for conditional video synthesis have limited controllability - classifier-free guidance models joint distributions indirectly, while classifier-based guidance can produce adversarial artifacts without genuinely satisfying conditions.

Method: Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD) aligns model attention maps with external control signals, uses sparse 3D-aware object layout conditioning, Layout ControlNet, and automated annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration.

Result: Extensive experiments show ACD delivers superior alignment with conditioning inputs while preserving temporal coherence and visual fidelity on benchmark video generation datasets.

Conclusion: ACD establishes an effective paradigm for conditional video synthesis with direct control through attention supervision, overcoming limitations of existing guidance methods.

Abstract: Controllability is a fundamental requirement in video synthesis, where accurate alignment with conditioning signals is essential. Existing classifier-free guidance methods typically achieve conditioning indirectly by modeling the joint distribution of data and conditions, which often results in limited controllability over the specified conditions. Classifier-based guidance enforces conditions through an external classifier, but the model may exploit this mechanism to raise the classifier score without genuinely satisfying the intended condition, resulting in adversarial artifacts and limited effective controllability. In this paper, we propose Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD), a novel framework for direct conditional control in video diffusion models via attention supervision. By aligning the model's attention maps with external control signals, ACD achieves better controllability. To support this, we introduce a sparse 3D-aware object layout as an efficient conditioning signal, along with a dedicated Layout ControlNet and an automated annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration. Extensive experiments on benchmark video generation datasets demonstrate that ACD delivers superior alignment with conditioning inputs while preserving temporal coherence and visual fidelity, establishing an effective paradigm for conditional video synthesis.

### [55] [GriDiT: Factorized Grid-Based Diffusion for Efficient Long Image Sequence Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21276)
*Snehal Singh Tomar,Alexandros Graikos,Arjun Krishna,Dimitris Samaras,Klaus Mueller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for image sequence generation by factorizing the process into coarse sequence generation at low resolution followed by individual frame super-resolution, outperforming current methods in quality, coherence, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art image sequence generation methods treat sequences as large tensors of stacked frames, which leads to inefficiencies and bottlenecks. The authors aim to develop a more effective representation and generation process for image sequences.

Method: The method factorizes image sequence generation into two stages: 1) generating coarse sequences at low resolution using a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) trained on grid images of subsampled frames, which captures inter-frame correlations, and 2) individually super-resolving each frame to add high-resolution details. This extends a 2D image generator to function as a low-resolution 3D sequence generator without architectural changes.

Result: The method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences compared to existing models. It enables high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences with increased efficiency in inference time (at least twice as fast) and training data usage. The approach generalizes effectively across diverse data domains without requiring additional priors or supervision.

Conclusion: The proposed factorization approach overcomes key limitations of current state-of-the-art image sequence generation methods, offering better quality, coherence, efficiency, and generalization capabilities while maintaining a straightforward formulation.

Abstract: Modern deep learning methods typically treat image sequences as large tensors of sequentially stacked frames. However, is this straightforward representation ideal given the current state-of-the-art (SoTA)? In this work, we address this question in the context of generative models and aim to devise a more effective way of modeling image sequence data. Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames. Yet, we learn to generate image sequences, using the strong self-attention mechanism of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to capture correlations between frames. In effect, our formulation extends a 2D image generator to operate as a low-resolution 3D image-sequence generator without introducing any architectural modifications. Subsequently, we super-resolve each frame individually to add the sequence-independent high-resolution details. This approach offers several advantages and can overcome key limitations of the SoTA in this domain. Compared to existing image sequence generation models, our method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences. It also delivers high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences and increased efficiency in inference time and training data usage. Furthermore, our straightforward formulation enables our method to generalize effectively across diverse data domains, which typically require additional priors and supervision to model in a generative context. Our method consistently outperforms SoTA in quality and inference speed (at least twice-as-fast) across datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpikeSurgSeg: A spike-driven video Transformer framework for real-time surgical scene segmentation using SNNs that achieves comparable accuracy to ANN models with 8-20× faster inference on non-GPU platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for surgical scene segmentation have high computational demands that hinder real-time deployment in resource-constrained surgical environments. SNNs offer efficiency but face challenges with limited labeled surgical data and sparse video representations.

Method: Proposed SpikeSurgSeg framework with surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining for SNNs using layer-wise tube masking for spatiotemporal representation learning, combined with a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head for temporally consistent predictions.

Result: Achieves mIoU comparable to SOTA ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by at least 8×, with over 20× acceleration relative to foundation-model baselines on EndoVis18 and SurgBleed datasets.

Conclusion: SpikeSurgSeg demonstrates the potential of SNNs for efficient surgical scene segmentation with real-time capabilities on non-GPU platforms, addressing computational constraints in surgical environments while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Modern surgical systems increasingly rely on intelligent scene understanding to provide timely situational awareness for enhanced intra-operative safety. Within this pipeline, surgical scene segmentation plays a central role in accurately perceiving operative events. Although recent deep learning models, particularly large-scale foundation models, achieve remarkable segmentation accuracy, their substantial computational demands and power consumption hinder real-time deployment in resource-constrained surgical environments. To address this limitation, we explore the emerging SNN as a promising paradigm for highly efficient surgical intelligence. However, their performance is still constrained by the scarcity of labeled surgical data and the inherently sparse nature of surgical video representations. To this end, we propose \textit{SpikeSurgSeg}, the first spike-driven video Transformer framework tailored for surgical scene segmentation with real-time potential on non-GPU platforms. To address the limited availability of surgical annotations, we introduce a surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining strategy for SNNs that enables robust spatiotemporal representation learning via layer-wise tube masking. Building on this pretrained backbone, we further adopt a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head that produces temporally consistent predictions while preserving the low-latency characteristics of SNNs. Extensive experiments on EndoVis18 and our in-house SurgBleed dataset demonstrate that SpikeSurgSeg achieves mIoU comparable to SOTA ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by at least $8\times$. Notably, it delivers over $20\times$ acceleration relative to most foundation-model baselines, underscoring its potential for time-critical surgical scene segmentation.

*Suren Bandara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel multi-scale signal processing method for table edge detection that models row/column transitions as 1D signals, uses Gaussian convolution with increasing variances and statistical thresholding to detect stable structural edges in noisy table images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate table structure extraction from low-resolution/noisy images remains challenging. Transformer methods struggle with noisy inputs, while mask-based edge detection approaches suffer from noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational costs when applied directly to images.

Method: Models row and column transitions as 1D signals, processes them using Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances, applies statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges, then maps detected signal peaks back to image coordinates.

Result: Improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) from 67% to 76% on PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. Method is robust to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies.

Conclusion: Proposed multi-scale signal processing approach effectively detects table edges from masks, providing robust performance on noisy/low-resolution images and producing optimized structured tabular outputs suitable for downstream analysis.

Abstract: Structured data extraction from tables plays a crucial role in document image analysis for scanned documents and digital archives. Although many methods have been proposed to detect table structures and extract cell contents, accurately identifying table segment boundaries (rows and columns) remains challenging, particularly in low-resolution or noisy images. In many real-world scenarios, table data are incomplete or degraded, limiting the adaptability of transformer-based methods to noisy inputs. Mask-based edge detection techniques have shown greater robustness under such conditions, as their sensitivity can be adjusted through threshold tuning; however, existing approaches typically apply masks directly to images, leading to noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale signal-processing method for detecting table edges from table masks. Row and column transitions are modeled as one-dimensional signals and processed using Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances, followed by statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges. Detected signal peaks are mapped back to image coordinates to obtain accurate segment boundaries. Experimental results show that applying the proposed approach to column edge detection improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) a layout-aware metric evaluating both textual correctness and correct cell placement from 67% to 76% on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. The method is robust to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies and produces optimized structured tabular outputs suitable for downstream analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AndroidLens is a challenging evaluation framework for mobile GUI agents with 571 complex, long-latency tasks across 38 domains, featuring both static and dynamic evaluation with fine-grained metrics, revealing current models achieve only 12.7% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agent benchmarks are limited to simple tasks, few applications, and coarse metrics, failing to capture real-world complexity. There's a need for more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that reflect actual user scenarios and measure agent performance more accurately.

Method: Developed AndroidLens with 571 long-latency tasks (average 26+ steps) across 38 real-world domains in Chinese and English. Features static evaluation preserving real-world anomalies with multiple valid paths, and dynamic evaluation using milestone-based scheme with Average Task Progress (ATP) metric for fine-grained measurement.

Result: Even the best models achieve only 12.7% task success rate and 50.47% ATP, demonstrating the framework's challenging nature. Key challenges identified include handling environmental anomalies, adaptive exploration, and long-term memory retention.

Conclusion: AndroidLens provides a comprehensive, challenging benchmark for mobile GUI agents that better reflects real-world complexity. The low performance of current models highlights significant research gaps in handling real-world mobile automation tasks, particularly in anomaly handling, exploration strategies, and memory management.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents can substantially improve productivity by automating frequently executed long-latency tasks on mobile devices. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are still constrained to limited applications, simple tasks, and coarse-grained metrics. To address this, we introduce AndroidLens, a challenging evaluation framework for mobile GUI agents, comprising 571 long-latency tasks in both Chinese and English environments, each requiring an average of more than 26 steps to complete. The framework features: (1) tasks derived from real-world user scenarios across 38 domains, covering complex types such as multi-constraint, multi-goal, and domain-specific tasks; (2) static evaluation that preserves real-world anomalies and allows multiple valid paths to reduce bias; and (3) dynamic evaluation that employs a milestone-based scheme for fine-grained progress measurement via Average Task Progress (ATP). Our evaluation indicates that even the best models reach only a 12.7% task success rate and 50.47% ATP. We also underscore key challenges in real-world environments, including environmental anomalies, adaptive exploration, and long-term memory retention.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TICON is a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that enriches tile embeddings with slide-level context, improving performance across computational pathology tasks and enabling a slide-level foundation model with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard tile encoder pipelines extract embeddings without slide-level context, missing essential information for both local and global tasks. Different tile encoders excel at different tasks, requiring a unified model to contextualize embeddings from any tile-level foundation model.

Method: TICON uses a single shared transformer encoder pretrained with masked modeling objective to unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. It also pretrains an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model.

Result: TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (Patho-Bench). The slide-level foundation model outperforms SoTA models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs using only 11K WSIs.

Conclusion: TICON successfully addresses the need for contextualized tile embeddings in computational pathology, providing a unified approach that improves performance across diverse tasks and enables efficient slide-level foundation modeling with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: The interpretation of small tiles in large whole slide images (WSI) often needs a larger image context. We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench). Finally, we pretrain an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model, using only 11K WSIs, outperforming SoTA slide-level foundation models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-guided token pruning framework for SAM2 that improves efficiency by selectively reducing token density before temporal propagation, achieving up to 42.5% faster inference and 37.4% lower GPU memory usage while maintaining segmentation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2 vision foundation models have high computational and memory costs due to processing all visual tokens across time, regardless of relevance to target objects, limiting practical deployment and scalability.

Method: A text-guided token pruning framework that operates after visual encoding and before memory-based propagation. It uses a lightweight routing mechanism to rank tokens based on local visual context, semantic relevance from object-centric textual descriptions (user-provided or auto-generated), and uncertainty cues for ambiguous/boundary regions.

Result: Achieves up to 42.50% faster inference and 37.41% lower GPU memory usage compared to unpruned SAM2 baseline, while preserving competitive J and F segmentation performance across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, highlighting the potential of early token selection to improve scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a vision foundation model has significantly advanced in prompt-driven video object segmentation, yet their practical deployment remains limited by the high computational and memory cost of processing dense visual tokens across time. The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance. These results highlight the potential of early token selection to improve the scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose and systematically investigate popularity bias in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) that achieve significantly higher accuracy on famous buildings compared to ordinary ones, indicating reliance on memorization rather than generalizable understanding.

Method: Introduced YearGuessr dataset (55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries) with construction year labels (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as popularity proxy. Framed construction year prediction as ordinal regression and introduced popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify bias. Evaluated 30+ models including their YearCLIP model.

Conclusion: VLMs exhibit significant popularity bias, relying on memorization over generalizable understanding, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities that needs to be addressed for more robust AI systems.

Abstract: We expose a significant popularity bias in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), which achieve up to 34% higher accuracy on famous buildings compared to ordinary ones, indicating a reliance on memorization over generalizable understanding.

Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiStream is an efficient autoregressive framework for high-resolution video generation that reduces computational redundancy through spatial, temporal, and timestep compression, achieving up to 107.5x acceleration over baselines with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution video generation is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible due to excessive computational requirements.

Method: HiStream uses three compression strategies: 1) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; 2) Temporal Compression: chunk-by-chunk strategy with fixed-size anchor cache for stable inference; 3) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to cache-conditioned subsequent chunks.

Result: On 1080p benchmarks, HiStream achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. HiStream+ (with all three optimizations) achieves 107.5x acceleration, offering compelling speed-quality trade-offs.

Conclusion: HiStream makes high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable by dramatically reducing computational requirements while maintaining visual quality through systematic redundancy reduction across spatial, temporal, and timestep dimensions.

Abstract: High-resolution video generation, while crucial for digital media and film, is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible. To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.

*Matyas Bohacek,Nino Scherrer,Nicholas Dufour,Thomas Leung,Christoph Bregler,Stephanie C. Y. Chan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new method uses sparse autoencoders to automatically identify model weaknesses and benchmark coverage gaps by analyzing concept activations in LLM representations, revealing systematic underperformance on concepts like boundary-setting and safety, and benchmark overrepresentation of obedience-related concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardized LLM benchmarks provide aggregated metrics but obscure specific model weaknesses and imbalanced benchmark coverage. There's a need to automatically uncover both "model gaps" (where models are weak) and "benchmark gaps" (where benchmarks have imbalanced coverage) without manual supervision.

Method: Uses sparse autoencoders to extract concept activations from LLM internal representations, then computes saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data. This grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks.

Result: Applied to two open-source models and ten benchmarks, the method revealed: 1) Models consistently underperformed on concepts related to non-sycophantic behaviors (politely refusing requests, asserting boundaries) and safety discussions; 2) Benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, and instruction-following while missing core concepts within their intended scope.

Conclusion: The method provides a representation-grounded approach to evaluation that complements conventional aggregated metrics by offering concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. It reveals why models scored as they did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on standardized benchmarks. These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak ("model gaps") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves ("benchmark gaps"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

Abstract: Diffusion based approaches to long form text generation suffer from prohibitive computational cost and memory overhead as sequence length increases. We introduce SA-DiffuSeq, a diffusion framework that integrates sparse attention to fundamentally improve scalability for long document modeling.

Conclusion: TokSuite provides a systematic framework for studying tokenization's role in language models, revealing insights about different tokenizers' performance characteristics.

Abstract: Tokenizers provide the fundamental basis through which text is represented and processed by language models (LMs). Despite the importance of tokenization, its role in LM performance and behavior is poorly understood due to the challenge of measuring the impact of tokenization in isolation. To address this need, we present TokSuite, a collection of models and a benchmark that supports research into tokenization's influence on LMs. Specifically, we train fourteen models that use different tokenizers but are otherwise identical using the same architecture, dataset, training budget, and initialization. Additionally, we curate and release a new benchmark that specifically measures model performance subject to real-world perturbations that are likely to influence tokenization. Together, TokSuite allows robust decoupling of the influence of a model's tokenizer, supporting a series of novel findings that elucidate the respective benefits and shortcomings of a wide range of popular tokenizers.

*Ziyi Zhu,Olivier Tieleman,Caitlin A. Stamatis,Luka Smyth,Thomas D. Hull,Daniel R. Cahn,Matteo Malgaroli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adversarial training framework improves user simulator realism for mental health chatbots, enhancing failure mode detection and system evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic user simulation is crucial for training and evaluating task-oriented dialogue systems, but creating accurate human behavior simulators remains challenging. Effective simulators need to expose failure modes of the systems they evaluate.

Method: Adversarial training framework with competitive dynamic between generator (user simulator) and discriminator. Applied to mental health support chatbots, iteratively improves simulator realism through adversarial iterations.

Result: Fine-tuned simulators dramatically outperform zero-shot base models at surfacing system issues. Adversarial training enhances diversity, distributional alignment, and predictive validity. Strong correlation between simulated and real failure occurrence rates across diverse chatbot configurations while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes. Discriminator accuracy decreases drastically after three adversarial iterations, suggesting improved realism.

Conclusion: Adversarial training is a promising approach for creating realistic user simulators in mental health support TOD domains, enabling rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system evaluation before deployment.

Abstract: Realistic user simulation is crucial for training and evaluating task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, yet creating simulators that accurately replicate human behavior remains challenging. A key property of effective simulators is their ability to expose failure modes of the systems they evaluate. We present an adversarial training framework that iteratively improves user simulator realism through a competitive dynamic between a generator (user simulator) and a discriminator. Applied to mental health support chatbots, our approach demonstrates that fine-tuned simulators dramatically outperform zero-shot base models at surfacing system issues, and adversarial training further enhances diversity, distributional alignment, and predictive validity. The resulting simulator achieves a strong correlation between simulated and real failure occurrence rates across diverse chatbot configurations while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes. Discriminator accuracy decreases drastically after three adversarial iterations, suggesting improved realism. These results provide evidence that adversarial training is a promising approach for creating realistic user simulators in mental health support TOD domains, enabling rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system evaluation before deployment.

### [68] [Large Language Models Approach Expert Pedagogical Quality in Math Tutoring but Differ in Instructional and Linguistic Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20780)
*Ramatu Oiza Abdulsalam,Segun Aroyehun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs approach expert-level pedagogical quality in math tutoring but differ in instructional strategies - they underuse restating/revoicing while producing longer, more diverse, and more polite responses than human tutors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how closely LLM-generated tutoring responses align with expert human practice in mathematics instruction, comparing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics across expert tutors, novice tutors, and multiple LLMs.

Method: Controlled turn-level comparison where expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple LLMs respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. Analysis of instructional strategies (restating/revoicing, pressing for accuracy) and linguistic characteristics (lexical diversity, readability, politeness, agency).

Result: LLMs approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality but show systematic differences: they underuse restating/revoicing strategies characteristic of experts, produce longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Restating/revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy positively correlate with pedagogical quality, while higher agentic and polite language negatively correlate.

Conclusion: Recent LLMs exhibit pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors but rely on different instructional and linguistic strategies. Findings highlight the importance of analyzing both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics when evaluating tutoring responses across human tutors and intelligent tutoring systems.

Abstract: Recent work has explored the use of large language models for generating tutoring responses in mathematics, yet it remains unclear how closely their instructional behavior aligns with expert human practice. We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple large language models respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. We examine both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics of tutoring responses, including restating and revoicing, pressing for accuracy, lexical diversity, readability, politeness, and agency. We find that large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality on average but exhibit systematic differences in their instructional and linguistic profiles. In particular, large language models tend to underuse restating and revoicing strategies characteristic of expert human tutors, while producing longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Statistical analyses show that restating and revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy are positively associated with perceived pedagogical quality, whereas higher levels of agentic and polite language are negatively associated. Overall, recent large language models exhibit levels of perceived pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors, while relying on different instructional and linguistic strategies. These findings underscore the value of analyzing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics when evaluating tutoring responses across human tutors and intelligent tutoring systems.

### [69] [Investigating Model Editing for Unlearning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20794)
*Shariqah Hossain,Lalana Kagal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Model editing algorithms (ROME, IKE, WISE) adapted for unlearning can outperform baseline unlearning methods in forgetting quality but struggle with precise scope definition and preserving overall model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods are inefficient for large language models (LLMs) and often fail to fully remove information without degrading retained knowledge. Model editing algorithms address similar problems but focus on redirecting information rather than removal.

Method: Adapt model editing algorithms (ROME, IKE, WISE) for unlearning by designing new editing targets specifically for the unlearning setting, comparing their performance against baseline unlearning methods.

Result: Model editing approaches can exceed baseline unlearning methods in terms of quality of forgetting, depending on the specific setting. However, they face similar challenges to traditional unlearning techniques.

Conclusion: While model editing algorithms show promise for unlearning tasks and can outperform traditional methods, they still struggle with precisely defining what should be unlearned and maintaining overall model performance without damage.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove unwanted information from a model, but many methods are inefficient for LLMs with large numbers of parameters or fail to fully remove the intended information without degrading performance on knowledge that should be retained. Model editing algorithms solve a similar problem of changing information in models, but they focus on redirecting inputs to a new target rather than removing that information altogether. In this work, we explore the editing algorithms ROME, IKE, and WISE and design new editing targets for an unlearning setting. Through this investigation, we show that model editing approaches can exceed baseline unlearning methods in terms of quality of forgetting depending on the setting. Like traditional unlearning techniques, they struggle to encapsulate the scope of what is to be unlearned without damage to the overall model performance.

### [70] [Measuring Mechanistic Independence: Can Bias Be Removed Without Erasing Demographics?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20796)
*Zhengyang Shan,Aaron Mueller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B can reduce demographic bias while preserving demographic recognition capabilities, with attribution-based methods working best for race/gender stereotypes and correlation-based methods for education bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether demographic bias mechanisms are separable from general demographic recognition in language models, and whether models can be debiased while preserving their ability to detect demographics.

Method: Multi-task evaluation setup associating demographics with names, professions, and education levels; comparing attribution-based and correlation-based methods for locating bias features; using targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B model.

Result: Attribution-based ablations mitigate race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy; correlation-based ablations are more effective for education bias; removing attribution features in education tasks induces "prior collapse" and increases bias.

Conclusion: Demographic bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, and mechanistic inference-time interventions can enable surgical debiasing without compromising core model capabilities.

Abstract: We investigate how independent demographic bias mechanisms are from general demographic recognition in language models. Using a multi-task evaluation setup where demographics are associated with names, professions, and education levels, we measure whether models can be debiased while preserving demographic detection capabilities. We compare attribution-based and correlation-based methods for locating bias features. We find that targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B reduce bias without degrading recognition performance: attribution-based ablations mitigate race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy, whereas correlation-based ablations are more effective for education bias. Qualitative analysis further reveals that removing attribution features in education tasks induces ``prior collapse'', thus increasing overall bias. This highlights the need for dimension-specific interventions. Overall, our results show that demographic bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, and that mechanistic inference-time interventions can enable surgical debiasing without compromising core model capabilities.

### [71] [Semantic Deception: When Reasoning Models Can't Compute an Addition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20812)
*Nathaniël de Leeuw,Marceau Nahon,Mathis Reymond,Raja Chatila,Mehdi Khamassi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with symbolic abstraction when faced with semantic deceptions - novel symbols that carry misleading associations, revealing limitations in true reasoning capabilities and over-reliance on surface-level semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs possess genuine reasoning capabilities over novel symbolic representations, particularly in decision-making contexts where human values are at stake, by testing their ability to resist misleading semantic associations.

Method: Introduced semantic deceptions using novel symbols for digits and mathematical operators, then tested LLMs on simple calculations in this altered notation to assess abstraction capacity and resistance to misleading semantic cues.

Result: Semantic cues significantly deteriorated LLMs' performance on simple tasks, revealing limitations in symbolic manipulation and a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, with chain-of-thought potentially amplifying statistical correlations.

Conclusion: LLMs have fundamental limitations in symbolic reasoning, undermining claims of true reasoning abilities and raising ethical concerns for decision-making contexts where robust symbolic reasoning is essential and shouldn't be compromised by residual semantic associations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in situations where human values are at stake, such as decision-making tasks that involve reasoning when performed by humans. We investigate the so-called reasoning capabilities of LLMs over novel symbolic representations by introducing an experimental framework that tests their ability to process and manipulate unfamiliar symbols. We introduce semantic deceptions: situations in which symbols carry misleading semantic associations due to their form, such as being embedded in specific contexts, designed to probe whether LLMs can maintain symbolic abstraction or whether they default to exploiting learned semantic associations. We redefine standard digits and mathematical operators using novel symbols, and task LLMs with solving simple calculations expressed in this altered notation. The objective is: (1) to assess LLMs' capacity for abstraction and manipulation of arbitrary symbol systems; (2) to evaluate their ability to resist misleading semantic cues that conflict with the task's symbolic logic. Through experiments with four LLMs we show that semantic cues can significantly deteriorate reasoning models' performance on very simple tasks. They reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability for symbolic manipulations and highlight a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, suggesting that chain-of-thoughts may amplify reliance on statistical correlations. Even in situations where LLMs seem to correctly follow instructions, semantic cues still impact basic capabilities. These limitations raise ethical and societal concerns, undermining the widespread and pernicious tendency to attribute reasoning abilities to LLMs and suggesting how LLMs might fail, in particular in decision-making contexts where robust symbolic reasoning is essential and should not be compromised by residual semantic associations inherited from the model's training.

### [72] [EssayCBM: Rubric-Aligned Concept Bottleneck Models for Transparent Essay Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20817)
*Kumar Satvik Chaudhary,Chengshuai Zhao,Fan Zhang,Yung Hin Tse,Garima Agrawal,Yuli Deng,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EssayCBM is an interpretable essay grading framework that evaluates eight writing concepts instead of directly predicting grades, providing transparent feedback through a web interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated essay grading systems using large language models are black boxes, making it difficult for educators and students to understand how essays are evaluated. There's a need for interpretable assessment systems that provide transparent feedback.

Method: EssayCBM uses a rubric-aligned framework with eight dedicated prediction heads for specific writing concepts (Thesis Clarity, Evidence Use, etc.) on an encoder. Concept scores form a transparent bottleneck, and a lightweight network computes the final grade using only these concepts.

Result: EssayCBM matches the performance of black-box grading systems while providing actionable, concept-level feedback. Instructors can adjust concept predictions and instantly see updated grades through an intuitive web interface.

Conclusion: EssayCBM offers an interpretable alternative to black-box essay grading systems, enabling accountable human-in-the-loop evaluation with transparent concept-level feedback while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Understanding how automated grading systems evaluate essays remains a significant challenge for educators and students, especially when large language models function as black boxes. We introduce EssayCBM, a rubric-aligned framework that prioritizes interpretability in essay assessment. Instead of predicting grades directly from text, EssayCBM evaluates eight writing concepts, such as Thesis Clarity and Evidence Use, through dedicated prediction heads on an encoder. These concept scores form a transparent bottleneck, and a lightweight network computes the final grade using only concepts. Instructors can adjust concept predictions and instantly view the updated grade, enabling accountable human-in-the-loop evaluation. EssayCBM matches black-box performance while offering actionable, concept-level feedback through an intuitive web interface.

TL;DR: MediEval benchmark links EHRs to knowledge base for evaluating LLMs in medicine, identifying critical failure modes, and proposes CoRFu fine-tuning method to improve safety and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in medicine but adoption is limited by reliability and safety concerns. Existing evaluations either test factual knowledge in isolation or assess patient reasoning without verifying correctness, leaving a critical gap in comprehensive evaluation.

Method: Introduces MediEval benchmark linking MIMIC-IV EHRs to unified knowledge base (UMLS/biomedical vocabularies). Generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts. Uses 4-quadrant framework considering knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Proposes Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions.

Result: Identifies critical failure modes including hallucinated support and truth inversion that current LLMs frequently exhibit. CoRFu improves by +16.4 macro-F1 points over base model and eliminates truth inversion errors, demonstrating both higher accuracy and substantially greater safety.

Conclusion: MediEval provides systematic evaluation framework for medical LLMs, revealing critical safety issues. CoRFu fine-tuning method effectively addresses these risks, improving both accuracy and safety, enabling more reliable deployment of LLMs in medical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medicine, yet their adoption is limited by concerns over reliability and safety. Existing evaluations either test factual medical knowledge in isolation or assess patient-level reasoning without verifying correctness, leaving a critical gap. We introduce MediEval, a benchmark that links MIMIC-IV electronic health records (EHRs) to a unified knowledge base built from UMLS and other biomedical vocabularies. MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions. CoRFu improves by +16.4 macro-F1 points over the base model and eliminates truth inversion errors, demonstrating both higher accuracy and substantially greater safety.

*Shelly Schwartz,Oleg Vasilyev,Randy Sawaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates retrieval strategies for large knowledge bases where total relevant documents are unknown, measuring correlation between retrieval metrics and LLM-based response quality judgments, and introduces a new metric that works without knowing total relevant documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In realistic retrieval settings with large and evolving knowledge bases, the total number of documents relevant to a query is typically unknown, making recall impossible to compute. This limitation needs to be addressed for proper evaluation of retrieval systems.

Method: The paper evaluates established strategies for handling the unknown total relevant documents limitation by measuring correlation between retrieval quality metrics and LLM-based judgments of response quality. Experiments are conducted across multiple datasets with 2-15 relevant documents. A new simple retrieval quality measure is introduced that performs well without requiring knowledge of total relevant documents.

Result: The research shows how different retrieval strategies perform when total relevant documents are unknown, and demonstrates that their introduced retrieval quality measure performs well without requiring knowledge of the total number of relevant documents.

Conclusion: The paper provides evaluation methods for retrieval systems in realistic settings where total relevant documents are unknown, and offers a practical retrieval quality measure that works effectively without this knowledge.

Abstract: In realistic retrieval settings with large and evolving knowledge bases, the total number of documents relevant to a query is typically unknown, and recall cannot be computed. In this paper, we evaluate several established strategies for handling this limitation by measuring the correlation between retrieval quality metrics and LLM-based judgments of response quality, where responses are generated from the retrieved documents. We conduct experiments across multiple datasets with a relatively low number of relevant documents (2-15). We also introduce a simple retrieval quality measure that performs well without requiring knowledge of the total number of relevant documents.

Abstract: We introduce the Nemotron 3 family of models - Nano, Super, and Ultra. These models deliver strong agentic, reasoning, and conversational capabilities. The Nemotron 3 family uses a Mixture-of-Experts hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture to provide best-in-class throughput and context lengths of up to 1M tokens. Super and Ultra models are trained with NVFP4 and incorporate LatentMoE, a novel approach that improves model quality. The two larger models also include MTP layers for faster text generation. All Nemotron 3 models are post-trained using multi-environment reinforcement learning enabling reasoning, multi-step tool use, and support granular reasoning budget control. Nano, the smallest model, outperforms comparable models in accuracy while remaining extremely cost-efficient for inference.

*Shivraj Singh Bhatti*

TL;DR: Systematic study of small language models under compute constraints, showing attention-based models outperform MLPs in efficiency even at small scale, with architectural techniques from large models not always transferring well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically analyze how architectural choices and training budgets interact to determine performance in small language models under strict compute constraints, and understand whether techniques successful in large language models transfer to small-scale regimes.

Method: Progressive introduction of architectural components from linear next-token predictors to nonlinearities, self-attention, and multi-layer transformers, evaluated on character-level modeling of Tiny Shakespeare and word-level modeling of Penn Treebank and WikiText-2. Models compared using test negative log-likelihood, parameter count, and approximate training FLOPs.

Result: Attention-based models dominate MLPs in per-FLOP efficiency even at small scale. Increasing depth or context without sufficient optimization can degrade performance. Rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) and other architectural techniques successful in large language models do not necessarily transfer effectively to small-model regimes.

Conclusion: Small language models have different optimization characteristics than large models, with attention mechanisms providing efficiency advantages even at small scale, but architectural techniques from large models require careful evaluation for transfer to constrained compute environments.

Abstract: We present a systematic empirical study of small language models under strict compute constraints, analyzing how architectural choices and training budget interact to determine performance. Starting from a linear next-token predictor, we progressively introduce nonlinearities, self-attention, and multi-layer transformer architectures, evaluating each on character-level modeling of Tiny Shakespeare and word-level modeling of Penn Treebank (PTB) and WikiText-2. We compare models using test negative log-likelihood (NLL), parameter count, and approximate training FLOPs to characterize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our results show that attention-based models dominate MLPs in per-FLOP efficiency even at small scale, while increasing depth or context without sufficient optimization can degrade performance. We further examine rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), finding that architectural techniques successful in large language models do not necessarily transfer to small-model regimes.

### [78] [Where Did This Sentence Come From? Tracing Provenance in LLM Reasoning Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20908)
*Kaiyuan Liu,Shaotian Yan,Rui Miao,Bing Wang,Chen Shen,Jun Zhang,Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework to analyze whether distilled models maintain teacher behaviors in novel contexts, and proposes a teacher-guided data selection method based on teacher-student divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous reasoning distillation approaches lack detailed analysis of where distilled models' capabilities originate, and it's unclear whether students maintain consistent teacher behaviors in novel test-time contexts or regress to original patterns, raising concerns about generalization.

Method: Introduces a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework that compares predictive probabilities from teacher, original student, and distilled models for each action to classify actions into categories and trace their provenance. Also proposes a teacher-guided data selection method that directly compares teacher-student divergences on training data.

Result: Experimental demonstration shows distilled models can generate teacher-originated actions in test-time contexts, which correlate with and explain observed performance. The teacher-guided data selection method is validated across multiple teacher models and diverse student models.

Conclusion: The provenance-tracing framework provides insights into reasoning distillation, showing distilled models can maintain teacher behaviors in novel contexts. The proposed data selection method offers a principled approach for distillation, highlighting the utility of provenance analysis for improving reasoning distillation techniques.

Abstract: Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention. It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple representative teacher models and diverse student models. The results highlight the utility of our provenance-tracing framework and underscore its promise for reasoning distillation. We hope to share Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing and our insights into reasoning distillation with the community.

TL;DR: FEND is a multi-modal framework using speech and text to detect Alzheimer's, depression, and autism across languages, showing strong results for AD/depression but challenges with ASD due to dataset heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuropsychiatric disorders show linguistic/acoustic abnormalities that could serve as early biomarkers, but current approaches lack multi-lingual generalization and unified evaluation frameworks.

Method: Proposed FEND framework integrates speech and text modalities, evaluated on 13 multi-lingual datasets across English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, with systematic multi-modal fusion analysis.

Result: Multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity; modality imbalance is common; cross-corpus experiments show robust performance in consistent scenarios but degradation in multi-lingual/task-heterogeneous settings.

Conclusion: FEND advances automated, lifespan-inclusive, multi-lingual neuropsychiatric assessment by providing extensive benchmarks and performance analysis, encouraging adoption for fair comparisons and reproducible research.

Abstract: Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are characterized by linguistic and acoustic abnormalities, offering potential biomarkers for early detection. Despite the promise of multi-modal approaches, challenges like multi-lingual generalization and the absence of a unified evaluation framework persist. To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models. Cross-corpus experiments reveal robust performance in task- and language-consistent scenarios but noticeable degradation in multi-lingual and task-heterogeneous settings. By providing extensive benchmarks and a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors, FEND advances the field of automated, lifespan-inclusive, and multi-lingual neuropsychiatric disorder assessment. We encourage researchers to adopt the FEND framework for fair comparisons and reproducible research.

### [80] [Neural Probe-Based Hallucination Detection for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20949)
*Shize Liang,Hongzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A neural network-based framework using lightweight MLP probes for token-level hallucination detection in LLMs, achieving superior performance through nonlinear modeling of hidden states and automated layer optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate hallucinated content that limits their use in high-risk domains. Current detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and knowledge retrieval have limitations: they produce errors at high confidence levels and depend on retrieval efficiency/coverage. Probe methods using hidden-layer states offer real-time, lightweight advantages but traditional linear probes fail to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.

Method: Propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. Freeze language model parameters and use lightweight MLP probes for nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. Design a multi-objective joint loss function to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Establish a layer position-probe performance response model using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers.

Result: Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed MLP probe framework effectively addresses hallucination detection limitations by providing real-time, lightweight nonlinear modeling of LLM hidden states with automated optimization, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) excel at text generation and knowledge question-answering tasks, but they are prone to generating hallucinated content, severely limiting their application in high-risk domains. Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces reflection pretraining for protein/RNA language models to enable Chain-of-Thought reasoning by generating auxiliary "thinking tokens" that overcome the limited expressiveness of biological sequence token spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought prompting has advanced reasoning in NLP but cannot be applied to protein/RNA language models due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (amino acid tokens), which restricts complex reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces reflection pretraining for biological sequence models, enabling generation of auxiliary "thinking tokens" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically augments token sets to enhance biological language expressiveness and reasoning capacity.

Result: The pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining, demonstrating improved reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: By enhancing biological language expressiveness through reflection pretraining and auxiliary thinking tokens, the work enables Chain-of-Thought style reasoning in protein/RNA models, overcoming previous limitations and improving model performance.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced task-solving capabilities in natural language processing with large language models. Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary "thinking tokens" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.

TL;DR: MedMistake is an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes from LLM patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs to evaluate clinical reasoning in frontier LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations in clinical settings use multi-dimensional rubrics, but replicating specific mistakes across different LLM models requires manual effort. There's a need for an automated approach to extract and benchmark LLM mistakes in medical conversations.

Method: The MedMistake pipeline: (1) creates complex conversational data between LLM patients and LLM doctors, (2) runs evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across multiple dimensions, (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from identified mistakes. The approach generates MedMistake-All (3,390 QA pairs) and expert-validated MedMistake-Bench (211 questions).

Result: GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro currently fail to answer correctly on 3,390 QA pairs. Evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs on MedMistake-Bench shows GPT models, Claude, and Grok achieve the best performance. The datasets are publicly released on Hugging Face.

Conclusion: MedMistake provides an automated pipeline for extracting and benchmarking LLM mistakes in clinical settings, enabling systematic evaluation of medical reasoning capabilities across different models. The released datasets facilitate ongoing assessment of LLM performance in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in clinical settings using multi-dimensional rubrics which quantify reasoning quality, safety, and patient-centeredness. Yet, replicating specific mistakes in other LLM models is not straightforward and often requires manual effort. We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large. We found that GPT models, Claude and Grok obtained the best performance on MedMistake-Bench. We release both the doctor-validated benchmark (MedMistake-Bench), as well as the full dataset (MedMistake-All) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheLumos/MedicalMistakeBenchmark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selective distillation focusing only on CoT tokens can achieve ≈94% of full-sequence performance with 50% computational savings by training on just the first half of reasoning sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reasoning distillation from LLMs to smaller models is computationally expensive due to training on lengthy sequences containing prompt, chain-of-thought, and answer segments. The authors investigate how supervision allocation across different segments affects efficiency and performance.

Method: The authors analyze supervision allocation across P, CoT, and A segments, finding that selective knowledge distillation over only CoT tokens can be effective. They establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs, showing that training on only the first 50% of tokens retains most performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

Result: Training on only the first 50% of tokens in every training sequence retains ≈94% of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about 50% each. This demonstrates that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens.

Conclusion: Reasoning distillation can be made significantly more efficient by focusing on early reasoning tokens, providing a simple method for computation-quality tradeoffs. The findings suggest that prompt and answer information is often encompassed within CoT tokens, enabling selective distillation strategies.

Abstract: Distilling the reasoning capabilities from a large language model (LLM) to a smaller student model often involves training on substantial amounts of reasoning data. However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\approx94\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

*Xiaofeng Shi,Qian Kou,Yuduo Li,Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SFTKey is a two-stage fine-tuning method that addresses the attention imbalance in LLMs by first training on full CoT sequences for format, then focusing only on the final answer portion to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In conventional SFT for LLMs, models allocate disproportionate attention to long Chain-of-Thought sequences, reducing focus on the shorter but essential final answer portion whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality.

Method: SFTKey uses a two-stage training scheme: first stage applies conventional SFT to ensure proper output format, second stage fine-tunes only the Key portion (final answer) to improve accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families show SFTKey achieves average accuracy improvement exceeding 5% over conventional SFT while preserving correct format generation ability.

Conclusion: This study advances LLM fine-tuning by explicitly balancing CoT learning with additional optimization on answer-relevant tokens, addressing attention imbalance in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) component has become significant for complex reasoning tasks. However, in conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the model could allocate disproportionately more attention to CoT sequences with excessive length. This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats. Overall, this study advances LLM fine-tuning by explicitly balancing CoT learning with additional optimization on answer-relevant tokens.

TL;DR: DAS framework adapts node semantics using LLM-GNN feedback loop to handle structure-semantics heterogeneity in graphs


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph data have varying predictive signal sources (node semantics vs structural patterns), but fixed inductive bias models can't generalize across diverse graph domains. Existing model-centric approaches are limited by real-world graph diversity.

Method: Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement (DAS) couples fixed GNN with LLM in closed feedback loop. GNN provides implicit supervision to guide LLM semantic refinement, refined semantics feed back to update graph learner.

Result: Consistent improvements on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs, demonstrating effectiveness of data-centric semantic adaptation.

Conclusion: Data-centric approach treating node semantics as task-adaptive variable effectively addresses structure-semantics heterogeneity in graph learning.

Abstract: Graph-structured data exhibit substantial heterogeneity in where their predictive signals originate: in some domains, node-level semantics dominate, while in others, structural patterns play a central role. This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner. We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs. Results show consistent improvements on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric semantic adaptation under structure-semantics heterogeneity.

*Eduard Stefan Dinuta,Iustin Sirbu,Traian Rebedea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using semi-supervised learning with task-specific augmentations to improve safety classification for Large Language Models, addressing data acquisition challenges in safety training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety training for LLMs relies on large labeled datasets which are difficult to acquire, prone to errors, and often synthetic. There's a need for more efficient approaches to safety classification.

Method: The authors propose using semi-supervised learning techniques that leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, with emphasis on task-specific augmentations rather than general-purpose ones.

Result: Task-specific augmentations significantly increase performance compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques for safety classification of both LLM prompts and responses.

Conclusion: Semi-supervised learning with task-specific augmentations offers a promising alternative to traditional supervised approaches for LLM safety classification, addressing data acquisition challenges while improving performance.

Abstract: Safety for Large Language Models (LLMs) has been an ongoing research focus since their emergence and is even more relevant nowadays with the increasing capacity of those models. Currently, there are several guardrails in place for all public LLMs and multiple proposed datasets for training safety classifiers. However, training these safety classifiers relies on large quantities of labeled data, which can be problematic to acquire, prone to labeling errors, or often include synthetic data. To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests. Moreover, since augmentation is the central part of semi-supervised algorithms, we demonstrate the importance of using task-specific augmentations, which significantly increase the performance when compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClarifyMT-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM clarification behavior in multi-turn dialogues with diverse ambiguity sources and user personas, revealing LLMs' under-clarification bias and proposing ClarifyAgent to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM clarification benchmarks assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, failing to capture realistic multi-turn scenarios where users provide incomplete or ambiguous information in conversational settings.

Method: Introduced ClarifyMT-Bench with a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Constructed 6,120 multi-turn dialogues using hybrid LLM-human pipeline. Proposed ClarifyAgent approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning components.

Result: Evaluation of ten representative LLMs revealed consistent under-clarification bias - LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. ClarifyAgent substantially improved robustness across ambiguity conditions.

Conclusion: ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask vs. answer questions and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as conversational assistants in open-domain, multi-turn settings, where users often provide incomplete or ambiguous information. However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions. ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask, when they should answer, and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions.

TL;DR: SpidR-Adapt enables rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data through meta-learning, achieving 100x more data-efficient speech representation learning compared to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human infants acquire language units efficiently with minimal exposure, while current self-supervised speech models require massive data. This efficiency gap motivates developing more data-efficient speech representation learning methods.

Method: Introduces SpidR-Adapt with multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) as a bi-level optimization framework, uses first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO) for scalable meta-training, and stabilizes training with interleaved supervision alternating self-supervised and supervised objectives.

Result: Achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), outperforming in-domain language models after training on less than 1 hour of target-language audio, showing 100x more data-efficiency than standard training.

Conclusion: SpidR-Adapt provides a practical, architecture-agnostic path toward biologically inspired, data-efficient speech representations, bridging the gap between human language acquisition efficiency and machine learning models.

Abstract: Human infants, with only a few hundred hours of speech exposure, acquire basic units of new languages, highlighting a striking efficiency gap compared to the data-hungry self-supervised speech models. To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\times$ more data-efficient than standard training. These findings highlight a practical, architecture-agnostic path toward biologically inspired, data-efficient representations.

TL;DR: PTP enables parallel token prediction in language models by jointly predicting multiple dependent tokens in a single transformer call, reducing autoregressive decoding latency while maintaining modeling power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the latency bottleneck of autoregressive decoding in language models while avoiding the restrictive independence assumptions of existing multi-token prediction methods.

Method: PTP incorporates the sampling procedure into the model to jointly predict multiple dependent tokens in a single transformer call, trained either by distilling an existing model or through inverse autoregressive training without a teacher.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art speculative decoding performance on Vicuna-7B, accepting over four tokens per step on Spec-Bench, while proving PTP can represent arbitrary autoregressive sequence distributions.

Conclusion: Parallel generation of long sequences is feasible without loss of modeling power, as demonstrated by the universal PTP framework for parallel sequence generation.

Abstract: We propose Parallel Token Prediction (PTP), a universal framework for parallel sequence generation in language models. PTP jointly predicts multiple dependent tokens in a single transformer call by incorporating the sampling procedure into the model. This reduces the latency bottleneck of autoregressive decoding, and avoids the restrictive independence assumptions common in existing multi-token prediction methods. We prove that PTP can represent arbitrary autoregressive sequence distributions. PTP is trained either by distilling an existing model or through inverse autoregressive training without a teacher. Experimentally, we achieve state-of-the-art speculative decoding performance on Vicuna-7B by accepting over four tokens per step on Spec-Bench. The universality of our framework indicates that parallel generation of long sequences is feasible without loss of modeling power.

*Xinhe Wang,Jin Huang,Xingjian Zhang,Tianhao Wang,Jiaqi W. Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARC-style reasoning benchmarks may overstate AI reasoning deficiencies; the performance gap stems more from visual perception limitations than inductive reasoning shortcomings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the common interpretation that poor performance on ARC-style benchmarks indicates deficiencies in machine reasoning, and to test whether visual perception limitations are the primary bottleneck instead.

Method: Introduced a two-stage experimental pipeline that separates perception and reasoning: (1) perception stage converts each image to natural-language description independently, (2) reasoning stage induces and applies rules using these descriptions. Compared this against standard end-to-end evaluation across Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO datasets.

Result: Perception capability is the dominant factor in performance gaps; manual inspection shows ~80% of VLM failures stem from perception errors rather than reasoning errors.

Conclusion: ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges, potentially overstating machine reasoning deficiencies. Evaluation protocols should disentangle perception from reasoning when assessing AI progress.

Abstract: Reasoning benchmarks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) and ARC-AGI are widely used to assess progress in artificial intelligence and are often interpreted as probes of core, so-called ``fluid'' reasoning abilities. Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning.
  To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for evaluation protocols that disentangle perception from reasoning when assessing progress in machine intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked Diffusion Models offer flexible non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge where final output quality is highly sensitive to decoding order. The authors aim to formalize this issue and develop methods to control generation quality.

Method: The authors formalize the decoding order sensitivity problem, attributing quality variability to cumulative predictive uncertainty. They introduce Denoising Entropy as a computable metric to quantify this uncertainty, then propose two algorithms: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy to optimize decoding paths.

Result: Experiments show that entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. The methods effectively turn uncertainty from a liability into an advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.

Conclusion: The work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation in Masked Diffusion Models, demonstrating that uncertainty can be leveraged as a key advantage rather than a limitation for discovering high-quality solutions.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer flexible, non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy.

TL;DR: Efficient method for computing integer-constrained cone singularities to create rotationally seamless conformal parameterizations with low distortion, achieving 30× speedup over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for efficient computation of cone singularities that enable rotationally seamless conformal parameterizations with minimal distortion, particularly for high-genus surfaces where existing methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Alternating optimization of three discrete variables (vertex positions, integer-constrained angles, and number of cones) with explicit construction algorithm reducing problem scale, derivative formula for moving cones, and strategies including repositioning, adding cones, adaptive variable selection, and cone pairing.

Result: Achieves order-of-magnitude speedup (30× faster on average) compared to state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining comparable cone numbers and parameterization distortion, demonstrated on massive test dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient and practical solution for generating rotationally seamless, low-distortion conformal parameterizations through optimized integer-constrained cone singularities, with significant computational advantages over existing approaches.

Abstract: We propose an efficient method to compute a small set of integer-constrained cone singularities, which induce a rotationally seamless conformal parameterization with low distortion. Since the problem only involves discrete variables, i.e., vertex-constrained positions, integer-constrained angles, and the number of cones, we alternately optimize these three types of variables to achieve tractable convergence. Central to high efficiency is an explicit construction algorithm that reduces the optimization problem scale to be slightly greater than the number of integer variables for determining the optimal angles with fixed positions and numbers, even for high-genus surfaces. In addition, we derive a new derivative formula that allows us to move the cones, effectively reducing distortion until convergence. Combined with other strategies, including repositioning and adding cones to decrease distortion, adaptively selecting a constrained number of integer variables for efficient optimization, and pairing cones to reduce the number, we quickly achieve a favorable tradeoff between the number of cones and the parameterization distortion. We demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of our cones by using them to generate rotationally seamless and low-distortion parameterizations on a massive test data set. Our method demonstrates an order-of-magnitude speedup (30$\times$ faster on average) compared to state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining comparable cone numbers and parameterization distortion.

TL;DR: AirGS is a streaming-optimized 4D Gaussian Splatting framework that enhances free-viewpoint video by improving quality, reducing bandwidth/storage, and enabling real-time deployment through intelligent keyframe selection, temporal coherence modeling, and adaptive pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth/storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments for free-viewpoint video.

Method: AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats, identifies keyframes to enhance reconstruction quality, combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size, models delivery as an integer linear programming problem, and designs a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune Gaussian updates.

Result: AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, and reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to state-of-the-art 4DGS approaches.

Conclusion: AirGS presents a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that enables high-quality, low-latency free-viewpoint video experiences by rearchitecting the training and delivery pipeline, making it suitable for real-time and wide-scale deployments.

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive viewing experiences by allowing users to view scenes from arbitrary perspectives. As a prominent reconstruction technique for FVV generation, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) models dynamic scenes with time-varying 3D Gaussian ellipsoids and achieves high-quality rendering via fast rasterization. However, existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth and storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments. Therefore, we present AirGS, a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline to enable high-quality, low-latency FVV experiences. AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats and intelligently identifies keyframes to enhance frame reconstruction quality. It further combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size. To support communication-efficient transmission, AirGS models 4DGS delivery as an integer linear programming problem and design a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune the Gaussian updates to be transmitted, balancing reconstruction quality and bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to the SOTA 4DGS approaches.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: TexAvatars is a hybrid 3D head avatar representation combining analytic rigging with texel space for improved generalization to extreme expressions and poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D head avatar methods (rule-based analytic rigging or neural deformation fields) fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, especially in extreme reenactment scenarios. Texel-based avatars underutilize mesh structure and rely heavily on neural regressors, weakening geometric consistency and limiting extrapolation to complex deformations.

Method: TexAvatars combines explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with spatial continuity of texel space. It predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme pose and expression variations, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging head reenactment settings. Captures fine-grained expression effects including muscle-induced wrinkles, glabellar lines, and realistic mouth cavity geometry with high fidelity.

Conclusion: TexAvatars' hybrid representation combining analytic rigging with texel space improves generalization, interpretability, and stability for 3D head avatars, enabling better performance in extreme reenactment scenarios compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Constructing drivable and photorealistic 3D head avatars has become a central task in AR/XR, enabling immersive and expressive user experiences. With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability. Furthermore, TexAvatars captures fine-grained expression effects, including muscle-induced wrinkles, glabellar lines, and realistic mouth cavity geometry, with high fidelity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme pose and expression variations, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging head reenactment settings.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired MARL provides an effective approach for optimizing UAV coordination in 6G networks, demonstrating practical advantages over classical methods with publicly available implementation for reproducibility.

Abstract: This study introduces a quantum inspired framework for optimizing the exploration exploitation tradeoff in multiagent reinforcement learning, applied to UAVassisted 6G network deployment. We consider a cooperative scenario where ten intelligent UAVs autonomously coordinate to maximize signal coverage and support efficient network expansion under partial observability and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits VQCs as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA as a representative VQC based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution CTDE paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness. Radar chart and convergence analyses further show that QI MARL achieves a superior balance between exploration and exploitation compared to classical methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension of long-form content due to limited context windows. While knowledge graphs help provide structure, current KG-based RAG solutions are text-only and fail to leverage complementary visual insights, which are crucial for understanding multimodal documents.

Method: Introduces a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG system that incorporates visual cues into three key phases: (1) knowledge graph construction, (2) retrieval phase, and (3) answer generation process. This enables cross-modal reasoning by integrating textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts.

Result: Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that the approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora.

Conclusion: The multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG system successfully addresses limitations of text-only approaches by integrating visual information, enabling better cross-modal reasoning and improved content understanding across various question answering tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to dynamically access external information, which is powerful for answering questions over previously unseen documents. Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora.

Abstract: Foundation model reliability assessment typically requires thousands of evaluation examples, making it computationally expensive and time-consuming for real-world deployment. We introduce microprobe, a novel approach that achieves comprehensive reliability assessment using only 100 strategically selected probe examples. Our method combines strategic prompt diversity across five key reliability dimensions with advanced uncertainty quantification and adaptive weighting to efficiently detect potential failure modes. Through extensive empirical evaluation on multiple language models (GPT-2 variants, GPT-2 Medium, GPT-2 Large) and cross-domain validation (healthcare, finance, legal), we demonstrate that microprobe achieves 23.5% higher composite reliability scores compared to random sampling baselines, with exceptional statistical significance (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.21). Expert validation by three AI safety researchers confirms the effectiveness of our strategic selection, rating our approach 4.14/5.0 versus 3.14/5.0 for random selection. microprobe completes reliability assessment with 99.9% statistical power while representing a 90% reduction in assessment cost and maintaining 95% of traditional method coverage. Our approach addresses a critical gap in efficient model evaluation for responsible AI deployment.

### [103] [Reasoning Relay: Evaluating Stability and Interchangeability of Large Language Models in Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20647)
*Leo Lu,Jonathan Zhang,Sean Chua,Spencer Kim,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores whether partially completed reasoning chains from one language model can be reliably continued by another model, examining reasoning interchangeability as a measure of inference-time trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Chain-of-Thought prompting has advanced LLM reasoning, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. The authors want to explore whether reasoning chains can be transferred between models to examine inference-time trustworthiness and reliability under model substitution.

Method: They use token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from baseline models (Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct), then conduct continuation experiments with smaller models (Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct) to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. The evaluation pipeline uses truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM) to assess reasoning stability.

Result: Hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure. The PRM-based evaluation reveals that reasoning interchangeability is possible across models.

Conclusion: Interchangeability emerges as a behavioral property of reasoning models, offering insights into new paradigms for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems. This suggests reasoning chains can be transferred between models while maintaining coherence and reliability.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work focuses on improving model performance through internal reasoning strategies, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. In this work, we explore whether a partially completed reasoning chain from one model can be reliably continued by another model, either within the same model family or across families. We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. Our evaluation pipeline leverages truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM), providing a reproducible framework for assessing reasoning stability via model interchange. Evaluations with a PRM reveal that hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure. Our findings point towards interchangeability as an emerging behavioral property of reasoning models, offering insights into new paradigms for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of AI-driven applications powered by large language models has led to a surge in AI interaction data, raising urgent challenges in security, accountability, and risk traceability. This paper presents AiAuditTrack (AAT), a blockchain-based framework for AI usage traffic recording and governance. AAT leverages decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VC) to establish trusted and identifiable AI entities, and records inter-entity interaction trajectories on-chain to enable cross-system supervision and auditing. AI entities are modeled as nodes in a dynamic interaction graph, where edges represent time-specific behavioral trajectories. Based on this model, a risk diffusion algorithm is proposed to trace the origin of risky behaviors and propagate early warnings across involved entities. System performance is evaluated using blockchain Transactions Per Second (TPS) metrics, demonstrating the feasibility and stability of AAT under large-scale interaction recording. AAT provides a scalable and verifiable solution for AI auditing, risk management, and responsibility attribution in complex multi-agent environments.

*Esmail Gumaan*

TL;DR: MoAS dynamically selects optimal attention schemes (MHA, GQA, MQA) per token via learned routing, achieving MHA-level performance with better inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between modeling quality (MHA) and inference efficiency (MQA/GQA) in Transformer attention mechanisms, where current solutions force a fixed choice between performance and memory usage.

Method: Proposes Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS) with a learned router that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token, enabling conditional computation based on input characteristics.

Result: Dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms static mixture (2.3093) on WikiText-2, achieving performance competitive with MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency.

Conclusion: MoAS provides an effective approach to balance attention quality and efficiency through dynamic scheme selection, offering a promising direction for conditional computation in Transformer architectures.

Abstract: The choice of attention mechanism in Transformer models involves a critical trade-off between modeling quality and inference efficiency. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers the best quality but suffers from large Key-Value (KV) cache memory requirements during inference. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory usage but often at the cost of model performance. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Motivation: Early-stage candidate validation is a major bottleneck due to heterogeneous inputs (resumes, screening answers, code assignments, public evidence) that recruiters must manually reconcile

Method: Modular multi-agent system with: document/video preprocessing, structured profile construction, public-data verification, technical/culture-fit scoring with risk penalties, human-in-the-loop validation interface; LLM-orchestrated pipeline with strict constraints for reduced variability and traceable rationales

Conclusion: AI-driven hiring assistant significantly improves throughput and efficiency while maintaining human oversight, with proposed efficiency metric measuring expected time per qualified candidate

Abstract: Early-stage candidate validation is a major bottleneck in hiring, because recruiters must reconcile heterogeneous inputs (resumes, screening answers, code assignments, and limited public evidence). This paper presents an AI-driven, modular multi-agent hiring assistant that integrates (i) document and video preprocessing, (ii) structured candidate profile construction, (iii) public-data verification, (iv) technical/culture-fit scoring with explicit risk penalties, and (v) human-in-the-loop validation via an interactive interface. The pipeline is orchestrated by an LLM under strict constraints to reduce output variability and to generate traceable component-level rationales. Candidate ranking is computed by a configurable aggregation of technical fit, culture fit, and normalized risk penalties. The system is evaluated on 64 real applicants for a mid-level Python backend engineer role, using an experienced recruiter as the reference baseline and a second, less experienced recruiter for additional comparison. Alongside precision/recall, we propose an efficiency metric measuring expected time per qualified candidate. In this study, the system improves throughput and achieves 1.70 hours per qualified candidate versus 3.33 hours for the experienced recruiter, with substantially lower estimated screening cost, while preserving a human decision-maker as the final authority.

### [108] [From Fake Focus to Real Precision: Confusion-Driven Adversarial Attention Learning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20661)
*Yawei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Adversarial Feedback for Attention (AFA) training to improve Transformer attention distribution in sentiment analysis by dynamically redistributing weights to task-relevant but less common words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer models for sentiment analysis often focus attention on common words while overlooking less popular but highly task-relevant terms, leading to suboptimal accuracy. Current attention mechanisms fail to properly identify and weight important but less frequent vocabulary.

Method: Introduces Adversarial Feedback for Attention (AFA) training with: 1) Dynamic masking strategy that masks various words to deceive a discriminator, 2) Discriminator that detects differences from masks, 3) Policy gradient optimization leveraging Transformer sensitivity to token-level perturbations to optimize attention distributions efficiently.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on three public datasets. When applied to enhance attention in large language models, yields further performance improvement of 12.6%.

Conclusion: AFA training effectively addresses attention distribution issues in Transformer models for sentiment analysis, automatically redistributing attention to appropriate focal points without manual annotations, leading to significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have been widely adopted for sentiment analysis tasks due to their exceptional ability to capture contextual information. However, these methods often exhibit suboptimal accuracy in certain scenarios. By analyzing their attention distributions, we observe that existing models tend to allocate attention primarily to common words, overlooking less popular yet highly task-relevant terms, which significantly impairs overall performance. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, applying this training mechanism to enhance attention in large language models yields a further performance improvement of 12.6%

*Yiqing Ma,Jung-Hua Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show laziness in complex tasks but surprising robustness against context degradation, with limited decoding suboptimality in simple reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify behavioral artifacts in LLMs including laziness (premature truncation/partial compliance), decoding suboptimality (myopic decoding), and context degradation (forgetting instructions).

Method: Three controlled experiments (A, B, C) across advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek) testing multi-part instruction compliance, reasoning task decoding, and 200-turn chaotic conversation context retention.

Result: Widespread laziness in complex multi-part instructions (omissions, length failures), limited decoding suboptimality in simple reasoning (greedy answers aligned with high-confidence solutions), and surprising robustness against context degradation in long conversations (maintained key facts/instructions).

Conclusion: While compliance with detailed instructions remains challenging, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (like context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios; recommendations include self-refinement and dynamic prompting to reduce laziness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit behavioral artifacts such as laziness (premature truncation of responses or partial compliance with multi-part requests), decoding suboptimality (failure to select higher-quality sequences due to myopic decoding), and context degradation (forgetting or ignoring core instructions over long conversations). We conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) to quantify these phenomena across several advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek). Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios. We discuss implications for reliability, relate our findings to prior work on instruction-following and long-context processing, and recommend strategies (such as self-refinement and dynamic prompting) to reduce laziness and bolster multi-instruction compliance.

### [110] [Eidoku: A Neuro-Symbolic Verification Gate for LLM Reasoning via Structural Constraint Satisfaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20664)
*Shinobu Miya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Eidoku is a neuro-symbolic verification system that detects LLM hallucinations by treating verification as a constraint satisfaction problem based on structural consistency rather than probability, using a lightweight System-2 gate to reject structurally disconnected statements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs frequently produce hallucinated statements that have high likelihood scores, showing that probability-based verification fails for "smooth falsehoods" - statements that are statistically plausible but structurally inconsistent. This reveals hallucination as a structural consistency failure rather than a low-confidence phenomenon.

Method: Reformulates verification as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) independent of generation likelihood. Uses structural violation cost - computational cost to embed reasoning steps into contextual graph structure. Defines total cost function with three proxies: (1) graph connectivity (structural), (2) feature space consistency (geometric), and (3) logical entailment (symbolic). Employs lightweight System-2 gate called Eidoku that rejects candidates exceeding context-calibrated cost threshold derived from intrinsic context statistics.

Result: Successfully rejects "smooth falsehoods" - highly probable yet structurally disconnected statements that probability-based verifiers cannot detect. Experiments on controlled diagnostic dataset show deterministic rejection of this specific class of hallucinations through explicit structural constraint enforcement.

Conclusion: Structural consistency verification via CSP approach provides neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning, addressing fundamental limitation of probability-based verification by detecting hallucinations that are statistically plausible but structurally inconsistent.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce hallucinated statements that are assigned high likelihood by the model itself, exposing a fundamental limitation of probability-based verification. This suggests that hallucination is often not a low-confidence phenomenon, but a failure of structural consistency. In this work, we reformulate the verification of LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) operating independently of the generation likelihood. Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic). Crucially, verification is performed via a lightweight System-2 gate, Eidoku, which rejects candidates exceeding a context-calibrated cost threshold. The threshold is not learned but is derived from the intrinsic statistics of the context, avoiding ad hoc heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach successfully rejects ``smooth falsehoods'' -- statements that are highly probable yet structurally disconnected -- that probability-based verifiers are principally incapable of detecting. Our experiments on a controlled diagnostic dataset show that explicitly enforcing structural constraints allows for the deterministic rejection of this specific class of hallucinations, serving as a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning.

TL;DR: This position paper identifies a gap between Functional TAI (implementation-focused) and Normative TAI (regulation-focused), and proposes developing a semantic language to bridge them for better AI trustworthiness assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the growing importance of Trustworthy AI (TAI) due to regulations and functional benefits, but recognizes that gaps between functional implementation (FTAI) and normative regulations (NTAI) make it difficult to assess AI system trustworthiness.

Method: As a position paper, it describes the current state-of-the-art, identifies the FTAI-NTAI gap, discusses starting points for developing a semantic language, and provides key considerations for future actions.

Result: The paper argues that a conceptual semantic language is needed to bridge FTAI and NTAI, which would help developers assess AI trustworthiness and help stakeholders translate regulations into concrete implementation steps.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by providing key considerations and discussing future actions needed to develop assessment frameworks for Trustworthy AI through a semantic language that bridges functional and normative perspectives.

Abstract: Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI) is gaining traction due to regulations and functional benefits. While Functional TAI (FTAI) focuses on how to implement trustworthy systems, Normative TAI (NTAI) focuses on regulations that need to be enforced. However, gaps between FTAI and NTAI remain, making it difficult to assess trustworthiness of AI systems. We argue that a bridge is needed, specifically by introducing a conceptual language which can match FTAI and NTAI. Such a semantic language can assist developers as a framework to assess AI systems in terms of trustworthiness. It can also help stakeholders translate norms and regulations into concrete implementation steps for their systems. In this position paper, we describe the current state-of-the-art and identify the gap between FTAI and NTAI. We will discuss starting points for developing a semantic language and the envisioned effects of it. Finally, we provide key considerations and discuss future actions towards assessment of TAI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While generative AI enables personalized CS education at scale, questions remain about whether such personalization supports or undermines learning. The review aims to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts.

Method: Scoping review of 32 studies purposively sampled from 259 records (2023-2025). Identified five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review. Analyzed how design choices shape learning outcomes.

Result: Designs with explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding show more positive learning outcomes. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure, and human-in-the-loop quality assurance.

Conclusion: Generative AI can provide precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support. Proposed exploration-first adoption framework with emphasis on piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling, while addressing risks like academic integrity, privacy, bias, and over-reliance.

Abstract: Generative AI enables personalized computer science education at scale, yet questions remain about whether such personalization supports or undermines learning. This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation. The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support.

*Prajwal Ghimire,Keyoumars Ashkan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that the distinction between artificial and organic intelligence is less clear than the terminology suggests, as AI systems are fundamentally products of organic human cognition and inspired by biological intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the perceived dichotomy between artificial and organic intelligence, particularly in digital health contexts, by demonstrating how AI systems are deeply rooted in and inspired by organic intelligence.

Method: The paper employs conceptual analysis and philosophical examination of AI foundations, tracing how neural networks and decision-making algorithms are inspired by human neurobiology and evolutionary processes.

Result: The analysis reveals that AI development is not mystical but fundamentally about organization and adaptation, with organic intelligence serving as both the source of inspiration and the creative force behind artificial systems.

Conclusion: The boundaries between artificial and organic intelligence are far less distinct than the nomenclature suggests, as AI represents an extension of organic intelligence rather than a separate category.

Abstract: The term artificial implies an inherent dichotomy from the natural or organic. However, AI, as we know it, is a product of organic ingenuity: designed, implemented, and iteratively improved by human cognition. The very principles that underpin AI systems, from neural networks to decision-making algorithms, are inspired by the organic intelligence embedded in human neurobiology and evolutionary processes. The path from organic to artificial intelligence in digital health is neither mystical nor merely a matter of parameter count, it is fundamentally about organization and adaption. Thus, the boundaries between artificial and organic are far less distinct than the nomenclature suggests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o3 and DeepSeek-R1 have made progress in natural language reasoning but remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy on complex mathematical operations requiring precise computation.

Method: AgentMath integrates language models with code interpreters through three innovations: 1) Automated conversion of natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories for SFT data generation; 2) Agentic RL paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution for learning optimal tool-use strategies; 3) Efficient training system with asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware load balancing for 4-5x speedup.

Result: AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks: 90.6% on AIME24, 86.4% on AIME25, and 73.8% on HMMT25 with AgentMath-30B-A3B model.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines language reasoning with computational precision, validates the framework's effectiveness, and paves the way for building more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o3 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought. However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool calls.Extensive evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25. Specifically, AgentMath-30B-A3B attains 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8% accuracy respectively, achieving advanced capabilities.These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and pave the way for building more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.

### [115] [A Benchmark for Evaluating Outcome-Driven Constraint Violations in Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20798)
*Miles Q. Li,Benjamin C. M. Fung,Martin Weiss,Pulei Xiong,Khalil Al-Hussaeni,Claude Fachkha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers introduce a new benchmark to evaluate AI agent safety, finding that even state-of-the-art models exhibit high rates of outcome-driven constraint violations when incentivized by KPIs, with superior reasoning capability not ensuring safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety benchmarks focus on single-step decisions, simulated environments, or explicit negative constraints, but lack evaluation of emergent outcome-driven constraint violations that arise when agents optimize goals under performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical/safety constraints in realistic multi-step scenarios.

Method: Introduce a new benchmark with 40 distinct scenarios requiring multi-step actions, each with Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Evaluate 12 state-of-the-art large language models on this benchmark.

Result: Outcome-driven constraint violations range from 1.3% to 71.4% across models, with 9 of 12 models showing misalignment rates between 30-50%. Gemini-3-Pro-Preview (one of the most capable models) exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Significant "deliberative misalignment" observed where models recognize their own actions as unethical during separate evaluation.

Conclusion: Superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety, and there is a critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate risks in real-world applications.

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant "deliberative misalignment", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.

### [116] [Safety Alignment of LMs via Non-cooperative Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20806)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdvGame frames safety alignment as a non-zero-sum game between Attacker and Defender LMs trained via online RL with preference-based rewards, improving both safety and utility while creating a strong red-teaming agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety alignment methods use sequential adversarial training which has limitations. The paper aims to create a more effective paradigm for ensuring language model safety while maintaining usefulness.

Method: Frames safety alignment as a non-zero-sum game between Attacker and Defender LMs trained jointly via online reinforcement learning. Uses preference-based reward signals from pairwise comparisons instead of point-wise scores to reduce reward hacking.

Result: AdvGame shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, yielding a Defender LM that is simultaneously more helpful and more resilient to adversarial attacks. The Attacker LM becomes a strong, general-purpose red-teaming agent for probing arbitrary target models.

Conclusion: Game-theoretic approach with preference-based rewards provides a superior paradigm for language model safety alignment, creating both safer models and effective red-teaming agents through continuous adversarial adaptation.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of language models (LMs) while maintaining their usefulness remains a critical challenge in AI alignment. Current approaches rely on sequential adversarial training: generating adversarial prompts and fine-tuning LMs to defend against them. We introduce a different paradigm: framing safety alignment as a non-zero-sum game between an Attacker LM and a Defender LM trained jointly via online reinforcement learning. Each LM continuously adapts to the other's evolving strategies, driving iterative improvement. Our method uses a preference-based reward signal derived from pairwise comparisons instead of point-wise scores, providing more robust supervision and potentially reducing reward hacking. Our RL recipe, AdvGame, shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, yielding a Defender LM that is simultaneously more helpful and more resilient to adversarial attacks. In addition, the resulting Attacker LM converges into a strong, general-purpose red-teaming agent that can be directly deployed to probe arbitrary target models.

*Rashmeet Kaur Nayyar,Naman Shah,Siddharth Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces RL algorithms that learn state and action abstractions online for parameterized action spaces, enabling efficient learning in long-horizon, sparse-reward settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world sequential decision-making often involves parameterized action spaces with both discrete actions and continuous parameters, but existing approaches have limitations: planning methods need hand-crafted models, standard RL handles either discrete or continuous but not both, and few RL methods for parameterized actions rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit latent structure.

Method: The paper introduces algorithms that enable agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online, progressively refining these abstractions during learning to increase fine-grained detail in critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance.

Result: Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, the abstraction-driven approach enables TD(λ) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends RL algorithms to handle long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling autonomous learning of state and action abstractions, overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Real-world sequential decision-making often involves parameterized action spaces that require both, decisions regarding discrete actions and decisions about continuous action parameters governing how an action is executed. Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance. Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, our abstraction-driven approach enables TD($λ$) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent with multi-persona debaters improves LLM reflection diversity and performance, outperforming single-LLM reflection on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single LLM self-reflection exhibits degeneration where the model repeats the same errors despite knowing they're wrong, limiting reasoning improvement.

Method: Introduces multi-agent with multi-persona debaters to generate reflections, creating more diverse perspectives than single LLM reflection.

Result: Achieves 47% EM on HotPot QA and 82.7% on HumanEval, surpassing single LLM reflection performance on both reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Multi-agent multi-persona debating generates more diverse reflections that prevent degeneration and improve LLM reasoning performance.

Abstract: LLMs have shown the capacity to improve their performance on reasoning tasks through reflecting on their mistakes, and acting with these reflections in mind. However, continual reflections of the same LLM onto itself exhibit degeneration of thought, where the LLM continues to repeat the same errors again and again even with the knowledge that its wrong. To address this problem, we instead introduce multi-agent with multi-persona debators as the method to generate reflections. Through out extensive experimentation, we've found that the leads to better diversity of in the reflections generated by the llm agent. We demonstrate an accuracy of 47% EM HotPot QA (question answering) and 82.7% on HumanEval (programming), both performances surpassing reflection with a single llm.

### [119] [The Silent Scholar Problem: A Probabilistic Framework for Breaking Epistemic Asymmetry in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20884)
*Zan-Kai Chong,Hiroyuki Ohsaki,Bryan Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A probabilistic framework for bidirectional knowledge exchange between AI agents, using Beta-Bernoulli distributions with forgetting factors to quantify epistemic uncertainty and drive optimal active learning through knowledge sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous agents with LLMs and RAG are unidirectional consumers of information (epistemic asymmetry), leading to redundant reasoning and stagnant collective intelligence. Existing self-reflection frameworks lack probabilistic foundations to quantify certainty or justify external interactions.

Method: Proposes a formal probabilistic framework modeling agent beliefs using Beta-Bernoulli distributions with forgetting factor (γ) to isolate epistemic uncertainty. Establishes dual interaction drives: homeostatic motive (maintaining certainty against temporal decay) and optimal learning strategy (targeting maximum ambiguity for information gain). Introduces epistemic caching for scalability and shows how belief states serve as reward signals for RLHF and data filters for SFT.

Result: Simulation results show the uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments while maintaining high adaptability to concept drift.

Conclusion: The framework reframes public contribution as optimal active learning, where sharing solutions to elicit feedback becomes the most efficient method for agents to reduce their own uncertainty, enabling bidirectional knowledge exchange with non-altruistic motives.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are proficient consumers of digital content but remain unidirectional, a limitation we term epistemic asymmetry. This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift.

TL;DR: A blockchain-integrated multi-agent AI framework using LangChain and Hyperledger Fabric ensures secure, auditable autonomous decision-making in healthcare, smart cities, and supply chain applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While agentic AI systems offer flexibility and real-time reasoning for autonomous decision-making in critical domains like healthcare and smart cities, they raise significant concerns about trust, oversight, and information integrity that need to be addressed.

Method: The paper proposes a unified architecture combining LangChain-based multi-agent systems with permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric) to enable continuous monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable audit trails. The framework links perception-conceptualization-action cycles to blockchain governance that verifies inputs, evaluates actions, and documents outcomes.

Result: Experimental results from smart inventory management, traffic-signal control, and healthcare monitoring show that blockchain security verification effectively prevents unauthorized practices, provides full traceability of decision-making processes, and maintains operational latency within acceptable ranges.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a universal solution for implementing high-impact autonomous AI applications that balance autonomy with responsibility through blockchain-enabled security, traceability, and auditability.

Abstract: The application of agentic AI systems in autonomous decision-making is growing in the areas of healthcare, smart cities, digital forensics, and supply chain management. Even though these systems are flexible and offer real-time reasoning, they also raise concerns of trust and oversight, and integrity of the information and activities upon which they are founded. The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution. A Hyperledger Fabric-based system, action executors MCP-integrated, and LangChain agent are introduced and experiments of smart inventory management, traffic-signal control, and healthcare monitoring are done. The results suggest that blockchain-security verification is efficient in preventing unauthorized practices, offers traceability throughout the whole decision-making process, and maintains operational latency within reasonable ranges. The suggested framework provides a universal system of implementing high-impact agentic AI applications that are autonomous yet responsible.

TL;DR: AI system combines personal finance with diet optimization to create affordable, nutritionally adequate meal plans that adapt to food price fluctuations using multi-agent architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of limited household budgets and nutritional demands in middle-income environments where food prices fluctuate, aiming to combine affordability with nutritional adequacy.

Method: Price-aware agentic AI system with modular multi-agent architecture (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, health personalization agents) using shared knowledge base and substitution graphs to maintain nutritional quality at minimum cost.

Result: Simulations show 12-18% cost reduction vs static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy over 95%, and high performance with 20-30% price changes.

Conclusion: Framework successfully combines affordability with nutritional adequacy, providing viable approach for sustainable diet planning aligned with SDGs on Zero Hunger and Good Health.

Abstract: The issue of limited household budgets and nutritional demands continues to be a challenge especially in the middle-income environment where food prices fluctuate. This paper introduces a price aware agentic AI system, which combines personal finance management with diet optimization. With household income and fixed expenditures, medical and well-being status, as well as real-time food costs, the system creates nutritionally sufficient meals plans at comparatively reasonable prices that automatically adjust to market changes. The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization). These agents share the knowledge base and use the substitution graph to ensure that the nutritional quality is maintained at a minimum cost. Simulations with a representative Saudi household case study show a steady 12-18\% reduction in costs relative to a static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy of over 95\% and high performance with price changes of 20-30%. The findings indicate that the framework can locally combine affordability with nutritional adequacy and provide a viable avenue of capacity-building towards sustainable and fair diet planning in line with Sustainable Development Goals on Zero Hunger and Good Health.

*Yuwei Du,Jun Zhang,Jie Feng,Zhicheng Liu,Jian Yuan,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TrafficSimAgent is an LLM-based agent framework that simplifies traffic simulation for non-experts by using expert agents to interpret natural language instructions, plan workflows, and optimize decisions across multiple scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic simulators like SUMO and MATSim are complex and challenging for users without deep platform knowledge, creating barriers to conducting experiments and applying simulations to daily work.

Method: An LLM-based agent framework with cross-level collaboration: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions, plan workflows, and invoke MCP-compatible tools; low-level expert agents select optimal action plans based on real-time traffic conditions.

Result: TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions, produces reasonable outcomes even with ambiguous instructions, and achieves superior performance compared to other systems and SOTA LLM-based methods through expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization.

Conclusion: TrafficSimAgent successfully addresses the accessibility challenge of traffic simulation by providing an intuitive LLM-based framework that enables non-experts to conduct complex simulations through natural language interaction and automated expert decision-making.

Abstract: Traffic simulation is important for transportation optimization and policy making. While existing simulators such as SUMO and MATSim offer fully-featured platforms and utilities, users without too much knowledge about these platforms often face significant challenges when conducting experiments from scratch and applying them to their daily work. To solve this challenge, we propose TrafficSimAgent, an LLM-based agent framework that serves as an expert in experiment design and decision optimization for general-purpose traffic simulation tasks. The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous. Besides, the carefully designed expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization in TrafficSimAgent yields superior performance when compared with other systems and SOTA LLM based methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic XAI framework combines SHAP explainability with LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced agricultural recommendations, showing optimal improvement in early rounds (3-4) followed by quality decline with excessive refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XAI outputs are difficult for laypersons to understand, hindering trust in AI predictions. While LLMs can translate technical explanations, the integration of agentic AI (autonomous LLM agents with iterative refinement) with XAI remains unexplored.

Method: Proposed agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement. Tested as agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 Japanese fields. Conducted 11 refinement rounds (0-10) with explanations evaluated by human experts (12 crop scientists) and LLMs (14) across seven metrics.

Result: Framework enhanced recommendation quality with 30-33% average score increase from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. Excessive refinement caused substantial quality drop, revealing bias-variance trade-off: early rounds lacked depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance).

Conclusion: Strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed to optimize practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement. Provides evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.

### [124] [LLM Personas as a Substitute for Field Experiments in Method Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21080)
*Enoch Hyunwook Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based persona simulations can replace human A/B tests for algorithm evaluation when methods only observe aggregate outcomes and evaluation is algorithm-blind, making persona benchmarking equivalent to changing the test population.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Field experiments (A/B tests) are expensive and slow, creating bottlenecks for iterative method development in societal systems. LLM-based persona simulations offer a cheaper alternative, but it's unclear if they preserve the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against.

Method: The paper proves an if-and-only-if characterization: when methods observe only aggregate outcomes and evaluation is algorithm-blind, swapping humans for personas is just a panel change. The authors also define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and derive sample-size bounds for persona evaluations.

Result: Persona benchmarking is equivalent to changing the evaluation population when conditions are met. The paper provides explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.

Conclusion: LLM-based persona simulations can serve as valid benchmarks for algorithm evaluation under specific conditions, with usefulness determined by sample size requirements rather than fundamental validity limitations.

Abstract: Field experiments (A/B tests) are often the most credible benchmark for methods in societal systems, but their cost and latency create a major bottleneck for iterative method development. LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.

*Ahmed M. Hussain,Salahuddin Salahuddin,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current LLM safety mechanisms fail to understand context and user intent, creating vulnerabilities that can be exploited through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose critical vulnerabilities in current LLM safety approaches that focus only on explicit harmful content while overlooking contextual understanding and intent recognition, which malicious users can systematically exploit.

Method: Empirical evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) using circumvention techniques including emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification.

Result: Most LLMs' safety mechanisms were circumvented; reasoning-enabled configurations amplified exploitation effectiveness; only Claude Opus 4.1 showed some capability for intent detection over information provision.

Conclusion: Current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities requiring paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) safety approaches focus on explicitly harmful content while overlooking a critical vulnerability: the inability to understand context and recognize user intent. This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First evaluation of LLM-based medication safety review on real NHS primary care data reveals strong issue detection but poor comprehensive accuracy, with contextual reasoning failures as dominant problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs matching clinician performance on medical benchmarks, few are evaluated on real clinical data or examined beyond headline metrics, creating a gap in understanding their real-world clinical applicability and failure patterns.

Method: Retrospective study using population-scale EHR (2.1M adults) with strategic sampling for clinical complexity and medication safety risk; expert clinician reviewed 277 patients to grade LLM-identified issues and interventions; failure analysis with detailed vignettes.

Result: Primary LLM showed 100% sensitivity and 83.1% specificity for issue detection, but only 46.9% correctly identified all issues and interventions; dominant failure mechanism was contextual reasoning with five patterns: overconfidence, guideline misapplication, healthcare delivery misunderstanding, factual errors, and process blindness.

Conclusion: LLM-based clinical AI has significant shortcomings in contextual reasoning that must be addressed before safe deployment; requires larger-scale prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviors in clinical contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often match or exceed clinician-level performance on medical benchmarks, yet very few are evaluated on real clinical data or examined beyond headline metrics. We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\% [95\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\% [95\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\% [95\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts.

TL;DR: RoboSafe: A hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents that uses executable predicate-based safety logic to reduce hazardous actions by 36.8% while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents powered by vision-language models are vulnerable to hazardous instructions that trigger unsafe behaviors. Existing defenses using static rule filters or prompt-level control struggle with implicit risks in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments.

Method: Proposes RoboSafe with two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory: 1) Backward Reflective Reasoning that revisits recent trajectories to infer temporal safety predicates and trigger replanning, and 2) Forward Predictive Reasoning that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from long-term memory and multimodal observations.

Result: RoboSafe reduces hazardous actions by 36.8% compared to leading baselines while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms confirm its practicality.

Conclusion: RoboSafe provides an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code, offering effective runtime safety guardrails for embodied agents in complex environments.

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly capable of executing complex real-world tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to hazardous instructions that may trigger unsafe behaviors. Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.
