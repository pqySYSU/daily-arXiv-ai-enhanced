Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuralSSD is a neural Galerkin method for 3D implicit surface reconstruction from point clouds, using a novel energy equation and convolutional network to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit surface reconstruction methods lack explicit mechanisms to ensure tight fit between surfaces and input point cloud data, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality.

Method: Proposes NeuralSSD based on neural Galerkin method with a novel energy equation balancing point cloud reliability, and a convolutional network that learns 3D information for superior optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on ShapeNet and Matterport datasets in both surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability.

Conclusion: NeuralSSD provides higher-quality and accurate surface reconstruction by ensuring close adherence to input points and inferring valuable inductive biases from point clouds.

Abstract: We proposed a generalized method, NeuralSSD, for reconstructing a 3D implicit surface from the widely-available point cloud data. NeuralSSD is a solver-based on the neural Galerkin method, aimed at reconstructing higher-quality and accurate surfaces from input point clouds. Implicit method is preferred due to its ability to accurately represent shapes and its robustness in handling topological changes. However, existing parameterizations of implicit fields lack explicit mechanisms to ensure a tight fit between the surface and input data. To address this, we propose a novel energy equation that balances the reliability of point cloud information. Additionally, we introduce a new convolutional network that learns three-dimensional information to achieve superior optimization results. This approach ensures that the reconstructed surface closely adheres to the raw input points and infers valuable inductive biases from point clouds, resulting in a highly accurate and stable surface reconstruction. NeuralSSD is evaluated on a variety of challenging datasets, including the ShapeNet and Matterport datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability.

### [2] [nuCarla: A nuScenes-Style Bird's-Eye View Perception Dataset for CARLA Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13744)
*Zhijie Qiao,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nuCarla is a large-scale BEV perception dataset built in CARLA simulator that addresses the lack of standardized datasets for closed-loop autonomous driving development, providing nuScenes-compatible data and high-performance models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets are collected from real world under non-interactive conditions, limiting their value for closed-loop testing and causing E2E models to lag behind simple rule-based baselines due to lack of standardized large-scale datasets for learning intermediate representations like BEV features.

Method: Created nuCarla dataset within CARLA simulator with full nuScenes format compatibility, comparable scale to nuScenes but with more balanced class distributions, direct usability for closed-loop simulation, and high-performance BEV backbones.

Result: nuCarla provides both data and models as open benchmarks, substantially accelerating closed-loop E2E development and enabling reliable safety-aware research in autonomous driving.

Conclusion: nuCarla addresses the critical gap in closed-loop autonomous driving development by providing a standardized, large-scale BEV perception dataset that facilitates meaningful intermediate representation learning and closed-loop testing.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving heavily relies on closed-loop simulation, where perception, planning, and control are jointly trained and evaluated in interactive environments. Yet, most existing datasets are collected from the real world under non-interactive conditions, primarily supporting open-loop learning while offering limited value for closed-loop testing. Due to the lack of standardized, large-scale, and thoroughly verified datasets to facilitate learning of meaningful intermediate representations, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, closed-loop E2E models remain far behind even simple rule-based baselines. To address this challenge, we introduce nuCarla, a large-scale, nuScenes-style BEV perception dataset built within the CARLA simulator. nuCarla features (1) full compatibility with the nuScenes format, enabling seamless transfer of real-world perception models; (2) a dataset scale comparable to nuScenes, but with more balanced class distributions; (3) direct usability for closed-loop simulation deployment; and (4) high-performance BEV backbones that achieve state-of-the-art detection results. By providing both data and models as open benchmarks, nuCarla substantially accelerates closed-loop E2E development, paving the way toward reliable and safety-aware research in autonomous driving.

### [3] [Known Meets Unknown: Mitigating Overconfidence in Open Set Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13775)
*Dongdong Zhao,Ranxin Fang,Changtian Song,Zhihui Liu,Jianwen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework to address overconfidence in Open Set Recognition by using perturbation-based uncertainty estimation and two-stage unknown detection to better distinguish between known and unknown classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open Set Recognition models often assign high confidence to unknown samples that are semantically similar to known classes, causing misclassification due to inter-class overlap in feature space.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) perturbation-based uncertainty estimation using controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions, and 2) two-stage unknown detection with learning-based classifiers that leverage estimated uncertainty.

Result: Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to existing OSR methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap and enhances Open Set Recognition performance.

Abstract: Open Set Recognition (OSR) requires models not only to accurately classify known classes but also to effectively reject unknown samples. However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.

*Yogesh Kumar,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel object-aware temporal modeling approach for few-shot video object detection that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames to maintain temporal consistency and improve detection accuracy with limited labeled examples.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses few-shot video object detection challenges by maintaining temporal consistency and improving detection accuracy through selective feature propagation, demonstrating significant performance gains across multiple datasets and shot configurations.

Abstract: Few-shot Video Object Detection (FSVOD) addresses the challenge of detecting novel objects in videos with limited labeled examples, overcoming the constraints of traditional detection methods that require extensive training data. This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting. Further results demonstrate improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations. We make the code public at: https://github.com/yogesh-iitj/fs-video-vit

### [5] [FusionFM: All-in-One Multi-Modal Image Fusion with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13794)
*Huayi Zhu,Xiu Shu,Youqiang Xiong,Qiao Liu,Rui Chen,Di Yuan,Xiaojun Chang,Zhenyu He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents FusionFM, a unified generative approach for multi-modal image fusion that uses flow matching for efficient sampling and pseudo-label selection with refinement, achieving competitive performance across tasks with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal image fusion methods rely on task-specific models with high training costs and limited scalability, while generative methods suffer from slow inference due to complex sampling processes.

Method: Formulates fusion as probabilistic transport using flow matching, collects fusion results from SOTA models as priors with task-aware pseudo-label selection, introduces Fusion Refiner module for enhancement, and integrates elastic weight consolidation with experience replay for multi-task learning.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining lightweight model design.

Conclusion: The proposed FusionFM approach provides an efficient and unified solution for multi-modal image fusion with improved sampling efficiency and scalability across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Current multi-modal image fusion methods typically rely on task-specific models, leading to high training costs and limited scalability. While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Ist-Zhy/FusionFM.

### [6] [A Trajectory-free Crash Detection Framework with Generative Approach and Segment Map Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13795)
*Weiying Shen,Hao Yu,Yu Dong,Pan Liu,Yu Han,Xin Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework called Mapfusion uses diffusion models to generate realistic road segment maps and detect crashes by comparing monitored maps with generated ones, achieving accurate real-time crash detection without needing vehicle trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time crash detection is essential for proactive safety management and traffic efficiency, but traditional methods face limitations with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by using road segment maps directly for crash detection.

Method: A two-stage framework: 1) Mapfusion - a diffusion-based segment map generation model that adds noise to road segment maps and denoises them using temporal dynamics, enhanced with ControlNet for background context; 2) Crash detection by comparing monitored segment maps with generated maps from the diffusion model.

Result: Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes show the method effectively detects crashes.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework using diffusion models provides an effective solution for real-time crash detection without requiring vehicle trajectories, enhancing traffic safety management capabilities.

Abstract: Real-time crash detection is essential for developing proactive safety management strategy and enhancing overall traffic efficiency. To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.

### [7] [Synergizing Multigrid Algorithms with Vision Transformer: A Novel Approach to Enhance the Seismic Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13800)
*Huiwen Wu,Shuo Zhang,Yi Liu,Hongbin Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel adaptive two-grid foundation model (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding for seismic data that separates high/low frequencies and uses progressive training to improve seismic foundation model pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based foundation models need specialized approaches for seismic data due to its unique frequency characteristics, as existing vision transformers fail to effectively capture both high- and low-frequency seismic information.

Method: Uses spectrum decomposition to separate frequency components, hierarchical Hilbert encoding for data representation, and an adaptive training strategy that starts with coarse-level information then progressively focuses on fine-level features.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed training methods for seismic foundation models.

Conclusion: The research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies that account for the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, enhancing visual seismic foundation model pretraining.

Abstract: Due to the emergency and homogenization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology development, transformer-based foundation models have revolutionized scientific applications, such as drug discovery, materials research, and astronomy. However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.

### [8] [Passive Dementia Screening via Facial Temporal Micro-Dynamics Analysis of In-the-Wild Talking-Head Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13802)
*Filippo Cenacchi. Longbing Cao,Mitchell McEwan,Deborah Richards*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a language-free dementia screening method using facial micro-dynamics from short camera-facing videos, achieving high performance without speech or text analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable passive, scalable dementia screening using natural facial behaviors from unscripted videos, overcoming limitations of existing methods that rely on speech, scripted interviews, or clinical settings.

Method: Analyze temporal facial kinematics including blink dynamics, mouth/jaw motions, gaze variability, and head adjustments by stabilizing facial signals, converting micro movements into interpretable time series, and summarizing them into clip-level statistics that capture motion distribution across streams.

Result: On the YT DemTalk dataset (300 clips), the method achieved AUROC of 0.953, Average Precision of 0.961, F1-score of 0.851, and accuracy of 0.857, with gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics identified as most informative cues.

Conclusion: Facial temporal micro-dynamics provide sufficient information for effective dementia screening without speech or text, enabling scalable, language-free detection that is transferable across devices, topics, and cultures.

Abstract: We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.

### [9] [Can World Simulators Reason? Gen-ViRe: A Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13853)
*Xinxin Liu,Zhaopan Xu,Kai Wang,Yong Jae Lee,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-ViRe is a new benchmark that evaluates video generation models' Chain-of-Frames reasoning capabilities across six cognitive dimensions, revealing gaps between visual quality and actual reasoning depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation benchmarks focus on fidelity and alignment but fail to assess core cognitive abilities like multi-step planning and abstract reasoning, preventing systematic understanding of model capabilities.

Method: Developed a framework grounded in cognitive science that decomposes Chain-of-Frames reasoning into six cognitive dimensions and 24 subtasks, using multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation.

Result: Experiments on state-of-the-art systems revealed substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines for video models as reasoners.

Conclusion: Gen-ViRe provides the first quantitative assessment of video models' reasoning capabilities, offering diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators beyond visual quality.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.

### [10] [RSPose: Ranking Based Losses for Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13857)
*Muhammed Can Keles,Bedrettin Cetinkaya,Sinan Kalkan,Emre Akbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ranking-based losses to address three key problems in heatmap-based human pose estimation: MSE loss limitations, heatmap imbalance, and metric-loss discrepancy. The method improves correlation between confidence scores and localization quality, leading to better mAP performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve three main issues in heatmap-based pose estimation: (P1) MSE loss doesn't focus on peak localization, (P2) heatmap spatial and class imbalance, and (P3) discrepancy between mAP evaluation metric and loss functions.

Method: Proposed ranking-based losses that align with mAP evaluation metric. Applied to both 1D and 2D heatmaps across COCO, CrowdPose, and MPII datasets. Models trained with these losses are called RSPose.

Result: RSPose achieves 79.9 mAP with ViTPose-H on COCO-val, outperforming previous state-of-the-art. Also improves SimCC Resnet-50 by 1.5 AP to 73.6 AP on COCO-val. Shows superior correlation between confidence scores and localization quality.

Conclusion: Ranking-based losses effectively address key limitations in heatmap-based pose estimation, providing better alignment with evaluation metrics and improving performance across multiple datasets and model architectures.

Abstract: While heatmap-based human pose estimation methods have shown strong performance, they suffer from three main problems: (P1) "Commonly used Mean Squared Error (MSE)" Loss may not always improve joint localization because it penalizes all pixel deviations equally, without focusing explicitly on sharpening and correctly localizing the peak corresponding to the joint; (P2) heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced; and, (P3) there is a discrepancy between the evaluation metric (i.e., mAP) and the loss functions.
  We propose ranking-based losses to address these issues.
  Both theoretically and empirically, we show that our proposed losses are superior to commonly used heatmap losses (MSE, KL-Divergence). Our losses considerably increase the correlation between confidence scores and localization qualities, which is desirable because higher correlation leads to more accurate instance selection during Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and better Average Precision (mAP) performance. We refer to the models trained with our losses as RSPose.
  We show the effectiveness of RSPose across two different modes: one-dimensional and two-dimensional heatmaps, on three different datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII).
  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose losses that align with the evaluation metric (mAP) for human pose estimation.
  RSPose outperforms the previous state of the art on the COCO-val set and achieves an mAP score of 79.9 with ViTPose-H, a vision transformer model for human pose estimation.
  We also improve SimCC Resnet-50, a coordinate classification-based pose estimation method, by 1.5 AP on the COCO-val set, achieving 73.6 AP.

### [11] [Segmenting Collision Sound Sources in Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13863)
*Kranti Kumar Parida,Omar Emara,Hazel Doughty,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), a novel task to segment objects responsible for collision sounds in videos using audio conditioning. It addresses challenges in egocentric videos where collision sounds involve interactions between objects in cluttered scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human multisensory perception, the authors aim to recognize object properties from collision sounds and segment the responsible objects in visual input, particularly in challenging egocentric video scenarios.

Method: Proposes a weakly-supervised method using foundation models (CLIP and SAM2) with audio-conditioned segmentation, incorporating egocentric cues like objects in hands to identify potential collision sound sources.

Result: The approach outperforms competitive baselines by 3× and 4.7× in mIoU on two new benchmarks: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

Conclusion: The CS3 task and proposed method effectively address the challenge of segmenting collision sound sources in egocentric videos, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline methods through the integration of audio-visual cues and egocentric information.

Abstract: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.
  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

### [12] [GRLoc: Geometric Representation Regression for Visual Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13864)
*Changyang Li,Xuejian Ma,Lixiang Liu,Zhan Li,Qingan Yan,Yi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Geometric Representation Regression (GRR), a geometrically-grounded alternative to Absolute Pose Regression that explicitly predicts disentangled 3D geometric representations (ray directions and pointmaps) to estimate camera pose, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Absolute Pose Regression models operate as black boxes that directly regress 6-DoF poses, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. The authors aim to introduce geometric priors into the localization process.

Method: Reformulates APR as inverse novel view synthesis by regressing two disentangled geometric representations: ray bundle directions for camera rotation and corresponding pointmaps for camera translation. Uses a differentiable deterministic solver to recover the final 6-DoF pose from these geometric components.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets. The explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions measurably boosts performance compared to black-box approaches.

Conclusion: Modeling the inverse rendering process through geometric representation regression provides a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation by introducing strong geometric priors and disentangling pose components.

Abstract: Absolute Pose Regression (APR) has emerged as a compelling paradigm for visual localization. However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver. This disentangled approach, which separates the learned visual-to-geometry mapping from the final pose calculation, introduces a strong geometric prior into the network. We find that the explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions measurably boosts performance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, validating that modeling the inverse rendering process is a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation.

*Xueyang Li,Zongren Wang,Yuliang Zhang,Zixuan Pan,Yu-Jen Chen,Nishchal Sapkota,Gelei Xu,Danny Z. Chen,Yiyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new multi-sequence MRI dataset for bladder cancer recurrence prediction and proposes H-CNN-ViT, a hierarchical model that combines CNN and ViT features, achieving 78.6% AUC and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bladder cancer has high recurrence rates (up to 78%) requiring accurate monitoring, but interpreting post-surgical MRI scans is challenging due to tissue alterations. AI tools show promise but lack dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment.

Method: Proposed H-CNN-ViT, a hierarchical gated attention multi-branch model that selectively weights features from global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on context. Processes each MRI modality independently to capture unique properties.

Result: The model achieved 78.6% AUC on their curated dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art models for bladder cancer recurrence prediction.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset provides a valuable benchmark, and H-CNN-ViT demonstrates effective feature fusion for improved bladder cancer recurrence detection, with the model being publicly available.

Abstract: Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with a recurrence rate of up to 78%, necessitating accurate post-operative monitoring for effective patient management. Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated. Evaluated on our dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/XLIAaron/H-CNN-ViT}.

*Xiaoyang Wei,Camille Kurtz,Florence Cloppet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QwenCLIP replaces CLIP's limited text encoder with an LLM-based embedding module to handle long radiology reports, using learnable prompts for better cross-modal alignment and improved medical image-text matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's 77-token limit and domain-specific encoders' 512-token constraint restrict handling of long, information-rich radiology reports, while shallow semantic understanding limits medical text comprehension.

Method: Replace CLIP's text encoder with LLM-based embedding module (Qwen3-Embedding), introduce learnable prompts for cross-modal alignment, leverage extended context window and richer LLM representations.

Result: Captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improves medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks.

Conclusion: QwenCLIP framework successfully addresses CLIP's limitations for medical applications by leveraging LLMs' extended context and rich representations, enabling better handling of long radiology reports.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong generalization for vision-language tasks in computer vision and medical domains, yet its text encoder accepts only up to 77 tokens, which limits its ability to represent long and information-rich radiology reports. Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Wxy-24/QwenCLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional transfer learning in medical image analysis, particularly for high-dimensional DICOM images, by developing a more sophisticated feature selection and representation framework.

Method: Hybrid architecture integrating EfficientNet and VGG19 with custom components: Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer for smart feature weight variations and Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer to remove redundancy, forming a multi-tiered framework.

Result: Significant performance improvement: precision 0.9, recall 0.861, F1 score 0.88, loss 0.18, accuracy 88.1%, outperforming baseline EfficientNet model.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully overcomes traditional transfer learning constraints in medical imaging and contributes to automated diagnostic tool development for lumbar spine pathology.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new enhanced model architecture to perform classification of lumbar spine degeneration with DICOM images while using a hybrid approach, integrating EfficientNet and VGG19 together with custom-designed components. The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet. This work will present the architectures, preprocessing pipeline, and experimental results. The results contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for medical images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based approaches for autonomous driving rely on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes using VLMs as semantic enhancers to enrich vision-based benchmarks with structured scene descriptions, then introduces a multi-modal interactive architecture fusing visual and linguistic features, plus a post-hoc refinement module for prediction reliability.

Result: Extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showing improved decision accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: The approach offers a promising direction for integrating VLMs into reliable and interpretable autonomous driving systems by shifting their role from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers.

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) have explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) within visual question answering (VQA) frameworks for direct driving decision-making. However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions. Building on this enriched representation, we introduce a multi-modal interactive architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features for more accurate decision-making and interpretable textual explanations. Furthermore, we design a post-hoc refinement module that utilizes VLMs to enhance prediction reliability. Extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a promising direction for integrating VLMs into reliable and interpretable AD systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches in digital hematopathology are limited by their inability to provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of different disease categories including malignant disorders, infectious conditions, and non-malignant red blood cell disorders.

Method: Built on Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at hierarchy level for different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling, visual question answering) at different granularity, using 46 publicly available datasets with over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs.

Result: Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to single-task, single-dataset models across diverse hematological tasks while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology, demonstrating unified reasoning capabilities across complex hematological conditions.

Abstract: Digital hematopathology requires cell-level analysis across diverse disease categories, including malignant disorders (e.g., leukemia), infectious conditions (e.g., malaria), and non-malignant red blood cell disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease). Whether single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell hematology models, these approaches share a key limitation, they cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-Hema, a multi-task, unified model for digital hematopathology integrating detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases. Uni-Hema leverages 46 publicly available datasets, encompassing over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs, and is built upon Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at the hierarchy level for the different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling and visual question answer) at different granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level. Our framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology. The code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First weakly supervised pipeline for ephemeral gully detection using Vision Language Models to reduce manual labeling, with a novel teacher-student approach and a new 18,000+ image dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ephemeral gullies are difficult to detect automatically due to short temporal cycles and scarcity of labeled data. Current ML approaches are limited to zero-shot methods that are hard to implement.

Method: Uses Vision Language Models to generate noisy labels, then employs teacher-student model where teacher learns from VLM labels and student learns via weak supervision with noise-aware loss function.

Result: Superior performance compared to VLMs and label model alone when using weak supervision to train student model. Created first-of-its-kind dataset with 18,000+ high-resolution remote-sensing images over 13 years.

Conclusion: The weakly supervised pipeline effectively addresses ephemeral gully detection challenges by leveraging VLM knowledge and teacher-student learning, providing a practical solution with publicly available code and dataset.

Abstract: Among soil erosion problems, Ephemeral Gullies are one of the most concerning phenomena occurring in agricultural fields. Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model. The code and dataset for this work are made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCVT studies focus on accuracy but overlook real-time performance and scalability, which are crucial for city-scale deployment as camera numbers increase in modern ITS.

Method: Distributed edge-central architecture where edge devices process video streams (object detection, tracking, geo-mapping, feature extraction) and transmit only lightweight metadata to central workstation for cross-camera association using self-supervised camera link model with spatial-temporal constraints.

Result: Achieves real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams with IDF1 score of 61.2 on RoundaboutHD dataset, demonstrating scalability for city-scale deployment.

Conclusion: SAE-MCVT is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework that successfully balances accuracy with practical deployment requirements, enabling city-scale intelligent transportation applications.

Abstract: In modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), cameras are a key component due to their ability to provide valuable information for multiple stakeholders. A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment.

TL;DR: CuRPO is a curriculum learning method that uses CoT length and gIoU rewards to progressively train visual grounding models from simple to complex examples, overcoming performance degradation from RL-based CoT fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning degrades performance in Visual Grounding tasks as CoT outputs become lengthy/complex, and increased dataset size doesn't always improve performance due to varying data complexities.

Method: Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO) uses CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples.

Result: CuRPO outperforms existing methods including Visual-RFT with up to +12.52 mAP improvement on RefCOCO, and shows exceptional efficiency and robustness in few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: CuRPO effectively addresses the limitations of RL-based CoT fine-tuning in visual grounding by progressively structuring training data, delivering strong performance particularly for tasks with ambiguous and intricate textual descriptions.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently shown significant promise across various NLP and computer vision tasks by explicitly generating intermediate reasoning steps. However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO. Moreover, CuRPO exhibits exceptional efficiency and robustness, delivering strong localization performance even in few-shot learning scenarios, particularly benefiting tasks characterized by ambiguous and intricate textual descriptions.The code is released on https://github.com/qyoung-yan/CuRPO.

TL;DR: Pretraining ViTs on procedurally-generated data without visual/semantic content improves data efficiency and performance when followed by standard image training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if generic inductive biases beneficial across modalities can be instilled in vision transformers through pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content.

Method: Generate procedurally-generated data using simple algorithms like formal grammars, pretrain ViTs on this data while bypassing visual patch embedding mechanisms, then follow with standard image-based training.

Result: Warm-up with procedural data significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k, 1% procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%, equivalent to 28% of ImageNet-1k data.

Conclusion: Procedural data pretraining offers a promising path toward data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies for vision transformers.

Abstract: Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data. These findings suggest a promising path toward new data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies.

Method: Learn continuous scalar fields parameterized by neural networks (UNet) where fields are solutions to Poisson PDE and heat equation diffusion. Segmentation is performed using watershed method on these learned fields. Training minimizes only field residuals without regularization.

Result: Competitive results on public datasets, demonstrating excellent cell segmentation performance. The method achieves robustness to outliers, sharp cell boundaries, and computational efficiency with reduced training/inference times and memory footprint.

Conclusion: The proposed simple yet geometrically insightful approach using scalar fields and watershed segmentation provides an effective solution for cell segmentation that is computationally efficient, robust to outliers, and suitable for edge computing applications.

Abstract: We investigate image segmentation of cells under the lens of scalar fields. Our goal is to learn a continuous scalar field on image domains such that its segmentation produces robust instances for cells present in images. This field is a function parameterized by the trained network, and its segmentation is realized by the watershed method. The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation. These solutions are obtained by minimizing just the field residuals, no regularization is needed, providing a robust regression capable of diminishing the adverse impacts of outliers in the training data and allowing for sharp cell boundaries. A single tensor is all that is needed to train a \unet\ thus simplifying implementation, lowering training and inference times, hence reducing energy consumption, and requiring a small memory footprint, all attractive features in edge computing. We present competitive results on public datasets from the literature and show that our novel, simple yet geometrically insightful approach can achieve excellent cell segmentation results.

Motivation: Current skill assessment models are specialized for individual sports and suffer from high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports.

Method: Discovers skill-attributes that transcend sport boundaries (e.g., balance, control, hand positioning) and trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback and proficiency levels for novel videos.

Result: Achieves gains up to 60% relative to state-of-the-art in both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: By abstracting shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes substantially better than existing techniques and enriches multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Skill assessment from video entails rating the quality of a person's physical performance and explaining what could be done better. Today's models specialize for an individual sport, and suffer from the high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports. Towards closing that gap, we explore transferable video representations for skill assessment. Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., "lift hands more to generate more power" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art. By abstracting out the shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes substantially better than an array of existing techniques, enriching today's multimodal large language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-prompt expert network with convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution that separates features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components and uses frequency and adaptive routing prompts to guide feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-contrast MRI super-resolution aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution scans using reference images with different contrasts, but contrast disparities between modalities make it challenging to effectively utilize reference image textures, leading to suboptimal feature integration.

Method: Proposed CD-DPE strategy with iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, and dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) using frequency prompt for reference feature selection and adaptive routing prompt for optimal fusion method.

Result: Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets show CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details, and experiments on unseen datasets demonstrate strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The CD-DPE approach effectively addresses contrast disparities in multi-contrast MRI super-resolution by decoupling features and using dual prompts for guided fusion, achieving superior reconstruction quality and generalization performance.

Abstract: Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) super-resolution intends to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) scans by leveraging structural information present in HR reference images acquired with different contrasts. This technique enhances anatomical detail and soft tissue differentiation, which is vital for early diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, inherent contrasts disparities between modalities pose fundamental challenges in effectively utilizing reference image textures to guide target image reconstruction, often resulting in suboptimal feature integration. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prompt expert network based on a convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) strategy for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce an iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, thereby reducing redundancy and interference. To fully integrate these features, a novel dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) is proposed. This module uses a frequency prompt to guide the selection of relevant reference features for incorporation into the target image, while an adaptive routing prompt determines the optimal method for fusing reference and target features to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details. Additionally, experiments on unseen datasets demonstrated that CD-DPE exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of optical sensors (RGB/LiDAR) which suffer from occlusions and privacy risks in indoor environments, while mmWave radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles but has low spatial resolution for reliable geometric reasoning.

Method: Proposes Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary reflections, and a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework to transform fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.

Result: RISE reduces Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to state-of-the-art in layout reconstruction, and achieves first mmWave-based object detection with 58% IoU. The benchmark contains 50,000 frames across 100 real indoor trajectories.

Conclusion: RISE establishes a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar, demonstrating that multipath reflections can be exploited for reliable geometric reasoning despite low spatial resolution.

Abstract: Robust and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding remains a fundamental open problem. While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.
  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.
  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a 2.5D context-aware classifier for identifying anatomical planes (axial, coronal, sagittal) in MRI slices, achieving 99.49% accuracy and reducing errors by 60% compared to 2D methods. The generated metadata improves brain tumor detection accuracy from 97.0% to 98.0% when used with a gated uncertainty strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated systems struggle to identify anatomical planes in 2D MRI slices, and missing plane orientation metadata complicates analysis, increases domain shift when merging datasets, and reduces diagnostic classifier accuracy.

Result: The 2.5D method achieved 99.49% accuracy, reducing errors by 60% compared to the 2D reference model (98.74%). In brain tumor detection, metadata-enhanced predictions with gated uncertainty strategy boosted accuracy from 97.0% to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%.

Conclusion: The 2.5D context is crucial for accurate plane orientation classification, and the generated metadata significantly improves downstream diagnostic tasks. The model is integrated into an open-source interactive web application.

Abstract: Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source.

### [31] [LINGUAL: Language-INtegrated GUidance in Active Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14028)
*Md Shazid Islam,Shreyangshu Bera,Sudipta Paul,Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LINGUAL is a framework that uses natural language instructions to automate medical image segmentation, reducing annotation effort by ~80% while achieving comparable or better performance than active learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active learning in medical image segmentation is challenging due to blurry boundaries and high cognitive demands. Traditional methods face a trade-off between annotation cost (larger ROIs) and precision requirements (smaller ROIs). Language guidance offers a less demanding alternative.

Method: LINGUAL framework receives natural language instructions from experts, translates them into executable programs via in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without human intervention.

Result: LINGUAL achieves comparable or superior performance to active learning baselines in active domain adaptation while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

Conclusion: Language-guided frameworks like LINGUAL provide an effective solution to reduce the cognitive burden and annotation costs in medical image segmentation tasks while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Although active learning (AL) in segmentation tasks enables experts to annotate selected regions of interest (ROIs) instead of entire images, it remains highly challenging, labor-intensive, and cognitively demanding due to the blurry and ambiguous boundaries commonly observed in medical images. Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

*Sungik Choi,Hankook Lee,Moontae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaRPAD is a training-free AI-generated image detection method that uses self-supervised models' sensitivity to resizing operations, leveraging wavelet decomposition to detect AI-generated images without requiring prior data knowledge or model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of vision-generative models necessitates effective AI-generated image detection without the need for dataset-specific training or prior data knowledge.

Method: WaRPAD uses self-supervised models pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop. It quantifies sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions via Haar wavelet decomposition, then rescales images to multiples of model input size, divides into patches, and computes detection scores by averaging patch scores.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models, showing strong robustness to test-time corruptions.

Conclusion: WaRPAD provides an effective training-free approach for AI-generated image detection that works across various self-supervised models and demonstrates consistent performance across diverse image sources and resolutions.

Abstract: AI-generated image detection has become crucial with the rapid advancement of vision-generative models. Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FashionMAC is a diffusion-based framework for garment-centric fashion image generation that preserves garment details without deformation and enables fine-grained control over human model appearance using region-adaptive attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for fashion image generation suffer from garment texture distortions due to deformation requirements and lack fine-grained controllability over model appearance, limiting their practical applications in e-commerce.

Method: Proposes a deformation-free framework that directly out-paints garments segmented from dressed persons, using region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism with chained mask injection to control fine-grained attributes.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-quality fashion showcase images with faithful garment preservation and enhanced controllability.

Conclusion: FashionMAC effectively addresses key challenges in fashion image generation by eliminating garment deformation and introducing fine-grained appearance control mechanisms, demonstrating significant improvements in visual fidelity and controllability.

Abstract: Garment-centric fashion image generation aims to synthesize realistic and controllable human models dressing a given garment, which has attracted growing interest due to its practical applications in e-commerce. The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models for flood prediction are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. Existing CNN-based approaches suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas.

Method: Leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, incorporating physics-informed inputs to enhance interpretability and using transfer learning for adaptation to new geographic regions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables real-time flood risk management by producing high-fidelity flood maps efficiently, addresses black-box limitations through physics-informed inputs, and demonstrates strong transfer learning capabilities for new geographic regions.

Abstract: Flood prediction is critical for emergency planning and response to mitigate human and economic losses. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly object detection and classification in concrete bridge structures is challenging, and there's a need for automated inspection methods using drone imagery to improve efficiency and accuracy in structural health monitoring.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Saliency-based defect region proposals that identify local discontinuities in surface patterns, 2) YOLOX-based deep learning detector applied to saliency-enhanced images using bounding-box level brightness augmentation.

Result: Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the framework's performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows significant potential for implementation in self-powered inspection systems for bridge defect detection and classification.

Abstract: Anomaly object detection and classification are one of the main challenging tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically detect, localize and classify defects in concrete bridge structures using drone imagery. This framework is constituted of two main stages. The first stage uses saliency for defect region proposals where defects often exhibit local discontinuities in the normal surface patterns with regard to their surrounding. The second stage employs a YOLOX-based deep learning detector that operates on saliency-enhanced images obtained by applying bounding-box level brightness augmentation to salient defect regions. Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the performance of our framework and its suitability in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which give a huge potential to be implemented in a self-powered inspection system.

*Dongyang Jin,Ryan Xu,Jianhao Zeng,Rui Lan,Yancheng Bai,Lei Sun,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCAR is a semantic-context-driven method for autoregressive image generation models that improves image editing through compressed semantic prefilling and semantic alignment guidance, achieving better instruction adherence and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models show promise for image generation but struggle with general image editing due to weak conditioning, poor instruction adherence, and visual artifacts. Current methods have semantic limitations and high computational costs.

Method: SCAR introduces two components: 1) Compressed Semantic Prefilling that encodes high-level semantics into efficient prefixes, and 2) Semantic Alignment Guidance that aligns visual hidden states with target semantics during decoding. It works with both next-token and next-set AR paradigms.

Result: SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability.

Conclusion: SCAR effectively addresses the limitations of autoregressive models in image editing by providing efficient semantic conditioning and alignment, demonstrating strong performance across different AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have shown strong potential in image generation, offering better scalability and easier integration with unified multi-modal systems compared to diffusion-based methods. However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability. All code will be released.

*Jingyu Lei,Gaoang Wang,Der-Horng Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORE introduces object-centric token compression for LVLMs using segmentation masks to guide merging, achieving state-of-the-art performance with extreme compression while maintaining 97.4% baseline performance with only 2.2% tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational and memory costs in LVLMs caused by quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution, overcoming limitations of existing token compression methods that lack high-level semantic understanding.

Method: Uses efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks as semantic prior, merges visual tokens into compact object-centric representations, and employs centroid-guided sorting to restore spatial order.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art on six benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings, maintains 97.4% baseline performance with only 2.2% visual tokens.

Conclusion: Demonstrates superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing, providing a new paradigm for visual token compression.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually suffer from prohibitive computational and memory costs due to the quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution. Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance. Our work demonstrates the superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing.

*Yao Qin,Yangyang Yan,YuanChao Yang,Jinhua Pang,Huanyong Bi,Yuan Liu,HaiHua Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS) using Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS) to directly generate classifier parameters from minimal task information (1-shot image + text), eliminating training requirements and achieving state-of-the-art performance on few-shot medical image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the fundamental constraint of deep learning models requiring large annotated datasets in medical domains where data is scarce and expert annotation is expensive, especially for rare diseases with limited samples.

Method: ZS-TMS framework uses SGPS to take minimal multi-modal task information (single image + clinical text) and directly synthesizes entire parameter sets for task-specific classifiers using a pre-trained generative engine, generating weights for lightweight classifiers without any training.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on few-shot classification benchmarks from ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and custom rare disease dataset, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot methods, especially in 1-shot and 5-shot regimes.

Conclusion: Enables rapid development and deployment of AI diagnostic tools for rare diseases with limited data by eliminating training requirements through direct parameter synthesis from minimal task information.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on "big data" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.
  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on 3D CT scans using a multi-stage approach with U-Net segmentation, landmark detection, and geometric fitting, achieving strong agreement with manual measurements and exceeding surgeon-to-surgeon consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual and semi-automated methods for measuring glenoid bone loss are time-consuming and subject to interreader variability, creating a need for more reliable and efficient automated solutions for preoperative planning in shoulder instability.

Method: Multi-stage deep learning pipeline with three main stages: (1) U-Net for automatic segmentation of glenoid and humerus, (2) neural network for glenoid rim point detection, and (3) geometric fitting using PCA, projection, and circle fitting to compute bone loss percentage.

Result: Automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings (ICC 0.84 vs 0.78 for surgeons), performed well in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21), and achieved recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity classification.

Conclusion: The method provides a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEER-3D introduces an error-driven framework using 3D scene editing to generate targeted counterfactuals for improving 3D-LLM grounding accuracy through iterative fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D-LLMs struggle with accurate language-to-visual/spatial grounding due to training data biases and scarce 3D resources, requiring a solution that addresses specific grounding failures without costly reconstruction.

Method: DEER-3D follows a "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow that diagnoses predicate-level errors and executes minimal 3D scene edits (recoloring, repositioning) to create targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning.

Result: The framework consistently improves grounding accuracy across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks through iterative refinement, demonstrating effectiveness across all evaluated datasets.

Conclusion: Targeted, error-driven scene editing effectively bridges linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs, providing a practical solution to inherent grounding biases without requiring large-scale 3D data collection.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments. This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.

Conclusion: GCA provides a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation underpins computer-aided diagnosis and therapy by supporting clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and disease monitoring. While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-based variants address global context but often require heavy computation and large training datasets. This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency. These results indicate that GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.

Method: BCE3S consists of three components: BCE-based joint learning for optimizing classifiers and features via multiple Sigmoid, BCE-based contrastive learning for improving intra-class compactness, and BCE-based uniform learning for balancing classifier separability.

Result: Extensive experiments show BCE3S achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-tailed datasets including CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018, with improved feature compactness and separability.

Conclusion: The proposed BCE3S framework effectively addresses long-tailed recognition challenges by decoupling imbalanced classifier vectors and synergistically combining joint, contrastive, and uniform learning approaches using binary cross-entropy.

Abstract: For long-tailed recognition (LTR) tasks, high intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in both head and tail classes, as well as balanced separability among all the classifier vectors, are preferred. The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AIO-IR) aims to develop a unified model that can handle multiple degradations under complex conditions. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration. Extensive experiments show that FAPE-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

*Yiqing Shen,Chenjia Li,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIVER is a reasoning-based implicit video editor that interprets implicit text queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods require explicit descriptions with precise spatial and temporal specifications, which is impractical when users want to make edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships.

Method: RIVER decouples reasoning from generation using digital twin representations of video content, employs a large language model for multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, and uses structured instructions to guide a diffusion-based editor for pixel-level changes. Training uses reinforcement learning with rewards for reasoning accuracy and generation quality.

Result: RIVER achieves best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark (100 videos with 519 implicit queries) and state-of-the-art performance on VegGIE and FiVE benchmarks, surpassing six baseline methods.

Conclusion: RIVER successfully addresses the challenge of reasoning video editing by interpreting implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmarks and establishing a new approach for intelligent video editing systems.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing enables users to modify video content only using text queries. While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing. RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional video editing benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), where it surpasses six baseline methods.

Conclusion: RTS-Mono successfully addresses the computational efficiency vs. performance trade-off in monocular depth estimation, enabling practical real-world deployment for autonomous driving and robotics with high accuracy and real-time performance.

Abstract: Depth information is crucial for autonomous driving and intelligent robot navigation. The simplicity and flexibility of self-supervised monocular depth estimation are conducive to its role in these fields. However, most existing monocular depth estimation models consume many computing resources. Although some methods have reduced the model's size and improved computing efficiency, the performance deteriorates, seriously hindering the real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models in the real world. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation method and implemented it in the real world. It is called RTS-Mono, which is a lightweight and efficient encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is based on Lite-Encoder, and the decoder is designed with a multi-scale sparse fusion framework to minimize redundancy, ensure performance, and improve inference speed. RTS-Mono achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in high and low resolutions with extremely low parameter counts (3 M) in experiments based on the KITTI dataset. Compared with lightweight methods, RTS-Mono improved Abs Rel and Sq Rel by 5.6% and 9.8% at low resolution and improved Sq Rel and RMSE by 6.1% and 1.9% at high resolution. In real-world deployment experiments, RTS-Mono has extremely high accuracy and can perform real-time inference on Nvidia Jetson Orin at a speed of 49 FPS.

TL;DR: Proposes A²GC-VPR, an asymmetric aggregation method for visual place recognition that addresses distributional discrepancies between image features and cluster centers using separate marginal calibration and geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Sinkhorn-based aggregation methods symmetrically treat source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers have substantially different distributions.

Method: Uses row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration for asymmetric matching, and incorporates geometric constraints through learnable coordinate embeddings fused with feature similarities.

Result: Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed asymmetric aggregation with geometric constraints effectively improves matching accuracy and robustness in visual place recognition tasks.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to match query images against a database using visual cues. State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a range of computer vision tasks; however, their high computational, memory, and energy demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose \emph{Cascaded-ViT (CViT)}, a lightweight and compute-efficient vision transformer architecture featuring a novel feedforward network design called \emph{Cascaded-Chunk Feed Forward Network (CCFFN)}.

TL;DR: Coffee is a method that uses language to specify undesired concepts during fine-tuning of text-to-image diffusion models, preventing the model from learning these concepts while maintaining alignment with user prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for text-to-image models can inadvertently learn undesired concepts from the training data and entangle them with user prompts, which is problematic for applications like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, and attribute disentanglement.

Method: Coffee regularizes the adaptation process by keeping embeddings of user prompts from aligning with undesired concepts specified through language descriptions, requiring no additional training and allowing flexible modification of undesired concepts.

Result: Experimental results show that Coffee effectively prevents text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: Coffee provides an effective solution for controllable fine-tuning of diffusion models by using language to specify and prevent learning of undesired concepts, enabling safer and more targeted model customization.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate diverse content with flexible prompts, which makes them well-suited for customization through fine-tuning with a small amount of user-provided data. However, controllable fine-tuning that prevents models from learning undesired concepts present in the fine-tuning data, and from entangling those concepts with user prompts, remains an open challenge. It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions. We evaluate Coffee by fine-tuning on images associated with user prompts paired with undesired concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that Coffee can prevent text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: MP-PVIR is a framework that analyzes multi-view pedestrian-vehicle incidents by segmenting them into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis, and generating comprehensive diagnostic reports with prevention strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian-vehicle incidents cause over 20% of global traffic fatalities, but existing video systems only detect when incidents occur without understanding how they unfold across cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior.

Method: A unified framework with four stages: event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and hierarchical synthesis with diagnostic reasoning. Uses specialized VLMs for phase segmentation and multi-view analysis.

Result: TG-VLM achieves mIoU = 0.4881 for phase segmentation, PhaVR-VLM achieves captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% QA accuracy. Framework effectively translates multi-view video into actionable insights on Woven Traffic Safety dataset.

Conclusion: MP-PVIR advances AI-driven traffic safety analytics by systematically processing multi-view incidents into structured diagnostic reports with causal chains and prevention strategies, enabling better understanding of pedestrian-vehicle incident dynamics.

Abstract: Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper unifies convolution and self-attention through a k-nearest neighbor framework, showing both are special cases of neighbor selection (spatial proximity vs feature similarity). The proposed ConvNN framework serves as a drop-in replacement and enables systematic exploration of the spectrum between these extremes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To dissolve the apparent distinction between convolutional neural networks and transformers by showing that both convolution and self-attention can be unified under a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum rather than being fundamentally distinct.

Method: Introduces Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN) framework that formalizes convolution and attention as special cases of neighbor selection. Validated on CIFAR-10/100 with two architectures: hybrid branching in VGG and ConvNN in ViT, exploring intermediate points between convolution and attention.

Result: Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets. ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Interpolating along the spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields.

Conclusion: The work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures by systematically exploring the continuous spectrum between these operations.

Abstract: The shift from Convolutional Neural Networks to Transformers has reshaped computer vision, yet these two architectural families are typically viewed as fundamentally distinct. We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields. Our work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the apparent distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iGaussian is a two-stage feed-forward framework for real-time camera pose estimation that uses direct 3D Gaussian inversion instead of iterative render-compare-refine loops, achieving 10x speedup over optimization-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera pose estimation methods rely on iterative render-compare-refine loops that are computationally expensive and hinder real-time performance in robotics applications.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Coarse 6DoF pose regression using Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention, 2) Refinement through feature matching and multi-model fusion with cross-correlation module aligning image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, and Weighted Multiview Predictor fusing features from multiple viewpoints.

Result: Significant performance improvement on NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T&T+DB datasets, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots - 10x speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

Conclusion: iGaussian enables real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion, eliminating the computational overhead of iterative rendering loops while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Recent trends in SLAM and visual navigation have embraced 3D Gaussians as the preferred scene representation, highlighting the importance of estimating camera poses from a single image using a pre-built Gaussian model. However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

TL;DR: RiSe framework addresses cross-domain generalization issues in multimodal face anti-spoofing by tackling modal representation and synergy invariant risks through Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization and Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal FAS methods suffer severe performance degradation in unseen domains due to two overlooked risks: modal representation invariant risk (class asymmetry amplifies generalization error) and modal synergy invariant risk (overfitting to domain-specific inter-modal correlations).

Method: Proposes RiSe framework with two components: 1) Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM) learns invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space while preserving domain cues in angular space; 2) Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD) uses self-supervised task with cross-sample mixing and disentanglement to enhance generalizable modal features.

Result: RiSe achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance in multimodal face anti-spoofing, with theoretical analysis and experiments verifying its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed RiSe framework successfully addresses cross-domain generalization challenges in multimodal FAS by mitigating both representation and synergy invariant risks, leading to improved performance in unseen domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) methods, which integrate multiple visual modalities, often suffer even more severe performance degradation than unimodal FAS when deployed in unseen domains. This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify RiSe, which achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.

Conclusion: MVI-Bench provides actionable insights to guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs, addressing a critical gap in visual understanding evaluation and enabling systematic assessment of model robustness against misleading visual inputs.

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is essential for their continued development and responsible deployment in real-world applications. However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.

### [56] [AdaTok: Adaptive Token Compression with Object-Aware Representations for Efficient Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14169)
*Xinliang Zhang,Lei Zhu,Hangzhou He,Shuang Zeng,Ourui Fu,Jiakui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an object-level token merging strategy for adaptive token compression in MLLMs, achieving 90% token reduction while maintaining 96% of vanilla model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-level tokenization in MLLMs causes quadratic token growth, computational burden, and misalignment with human vision cognition, leading to hallucination and redundancy.

Method: Object-level token merging strategy for adaptive token compression that aligns with human vision system by focusing on meaningful objects rather than patches.

Result: Achieves average 90% token reduction while maintaining 96% of vanilla model performance across multiple comprehensive benchmarks, outperforming relevant works in balancing compression and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed object-level token compression method effectively reduces computational burden while maintaining performance, demonstrating consistency with human vision cognition.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.

*Yanshan Li,Ke Ma,Miaomiao Wei,Linhui Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGCLR is a self-supervised contrastive learning framework for skeleton-based action recognition that uses game theory to dynamically balance positive and negative sample construction, with spatio-temporal localization and entropy-driven memory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods process all skeleton regions uniformly and use FIFO queues for negative samples, leading to motion information loss and suboptimal negative sample selection.

Method: Models sample construction as a Dominance Game with equilibrium-seeking, uses spatio-temporal dual weight localization for key motion regions, and implements entropy-driven dominance strategy for memory bank management.

Result: Achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy on NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, 71.2%/75.5% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, surpassing SOTA by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3% respectively. On PKU-MMD Part II, achieves 1.9% higher accuracy.

Conclusion: DoGCLR demonstrates strong performance and robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios, through its game-theoretic approach to contrastive learning with dynamic sample optimization.

Abstract: Existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based action recognition often process all skeleton regions uniformly, and adopt a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue to store negative samples, which leads to motion information loss and non-optimal negative sample selection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively. On PKU-MMD Part I/Part II, DoGCLR performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods and achieves a 1.9% higher accuracy on Part II, highlighting its strong robustness on more challenging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniSER is a foundational versatile model that addresses diverse image degradations caused by soft effects (lens flare, haze, shadows, reflections) in a single framework, outperforming both specialized and generalist models through a massive dataset and tailored training pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use highly specialized models for individual soft effects, lacking scalability and failing to exploit shared underlying characteristics. Generalist models require detailed prompts and often fail at fine-grained restoration tasks or scene identity preservation.

Method: Curated a massive 3.8M-pair dataset with novel physically-plausible data, and developed a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors with fine-grained mask and strength controls.

Result: UniSER significantly outperforms both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses diverse soft effect degradations within a single framework by leveraging their common essence as semi-transparent occlusions, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing specialized and general-purpose solutions.

Abstract: Digital images are often degraded by soft effects such as lens flare, haze, shadows, and reflections, which reduce aesthetics even though the underlying pixels remain partially visible. The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UMEG-Net is a unified multi-entity graph network for few-shot precise event spotting that integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph structure with efficient spatio-temporal extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise event spotting faces challenges due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Existing methods rely on large labeled datasets and struggle in few-shot conditions, while obtaining large labeled datasets is practically difficult.

Method: UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph, featuring efficient spatio-temporal extraction using advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. It employs multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations.

Result: The approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: UMEG-Net provides a scalable and effective solution for few-shot precise event spotting, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data through unified graph representation and knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Precise event spotting (PES) aims to recognize fine-grained events at exact moments and has become a key component of sports analytics. This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. However, obtaining large labeled datasets is practically hard. We propose a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UMEG-Net) for few-shot PES. UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations. Our approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings, providing a scalable and effective solution for few-shot PES.

*Xuan Zhao,Zhongyu Zhang,Yuge Huang,Yuxi Mi,Guodong Mu,Shouhong Ding,Jun Wang,Rizen Guo,Shuigeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GloTok introduces a global perspective tokenizer that uses codebook-wise histogram relation learning to create more uniform semantic distributions for better image generation quality, achieving SOTA results on ImageNet-1k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image tokenization methods use local semantic supervision which limits uniformity of semantic distribution, while VA-VAE shows that more uniform feature distributions yield better generation performance.

Method: Proposes Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok) with codebook-wise histogram relation learning to transfer global semantics to semantic codebook, and a residual learning module to recover fine-grained details from quantization errors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality on ImageNet-1k benchmark.

Conclusion: GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations that facilitate training autoregressive models for high-quality image generation without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during training.

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art image tokenization methods leverage diverse semantic features from pre-trained vision models for additional supervision, to expand the distribution of latent representations and thereby improve the quality of image reconstruction and generation. These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality.

*Yunhe Liu*

TL;DR: MCFormer is a transformer-based network for maritime vessel re-identification that addresses intra-identity variations and local part missing through multi-scale correlation modeling using global and local correlation modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vessel Re-ID methods adapted from pedestrian algorithms are ill-suited for handling unique challenges in vessel images, particularly greater intra-identity variations and severe local part missing that create outlier samples within the same identity.

Method: Proposes Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer) with Global Correlation Module (GCM) that constructs global similarity affinity matrix across all input images, and Local Correlation Module (LCM) that mines and aligns local features using dynamic memory bank to compensate for missing regions.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in maritime vessel re-identification.

Conclusion: MCFormer effectively addresses the challenges of intra-identity variations and local part missing in vessel Re-ID by modeling multi-scale correlations through global and local feature integration, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Maritime vessel re-identification (Re-ID) plays a crucial role in advancing maritime monitoring and intelligent situational awareness systems. However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets collected by human-driving or unidentified modes only serve as early training for perception and prediction, lacking the ability to evaluate real behavioral safety of autonomous vehicles in black-box scenarios.

Method: Collected over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production AV models, segmented into 32,727 key frames with synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm accuracy), providing vehicle trajectories and detailed 2D annotations.

Result: Dataset contains rich scenario-level attributes including driver intent, area types, lighting conditions, weather, road surfaces, traffic density, and traffic infrastructure. An end-to-end motion planning model achieves 1.4m ADE on autonomous-driving frames.

Conclusion: This dataset provides a sustainable foundation for AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation, with continuous expansion of 10+ hours of new data weekly, enabling comprehensive assessment of autonomous vehicle safety in real-world conditions.

Abstract: Most existing autonomous-driving datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes, and the Waymo Perception Dataset), collected by human-driving mode or unidentified driving mode, can only serve as early training for the perception and prediction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames. The dataset continues to expand by over 10 hours of new data weekly, thereby providing a sustainable foundation for research on AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper presents a curriculum learning approach with fractal softmax for hierarchical 3D aortic segmentation, addressing class imbalance and improving segmentation accuracy and efficiency for clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D aortic segmentation overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships and struggle with severe class imbalance in vascular structures, which limits their clinical practicality for minimally invasive repairs.

Method: Curriculum learning strategy with novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning, progressively learning anatomical constraints from simple to complex components, with a two-stage inference strategy for acceleration.

Result: Achieved 11.65% Dice score improvement over nnU-Net ResEnc M at epoch 50, 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on test set, and up to fivefold acceleration in inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time clinical applications in aortic pathology diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: The aorta, the body's largest artery, is prone to pathologies such as dissection, aneurysm, and atherosclerosis, which often require timely intervention. Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection due to its structural complexity and domain gaps, despite the proven effectiveness of data curation in other domains like classification and multimodal learning.

Method: DetGain estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level AP by modeling global score distributions, computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration, and is designed to be architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive.

Result: Experiments on COCO dataset with multiple detectors show consistent accuracy improvements. DetGain demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation to further enhance performance.

Conclusion: DetGain serves as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection, offering consistent performance gains across different architectures and conditions.

Abstract: High-quality data has become a primary driver of progress under scale laws, with curated datasets often outperforming much larger unfiltered ones at lower cost. Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces data privacy concerns and high annotation costs, while federated semi-supervised learning struggles with unreliable pseudo-labels from weak local models and computational limitations of client devices.

Method: SAM-Fed leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients through dual knowledge distillation and an adaptive agreement mechanism for refining pixel-level supervision.

Result: Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.

Conclusion: SAM-Fed effectively addresses the limitations of federated semi-supervised learning in medical image segmentation by combining foundation model guidance with adaptive supervision refinement.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is clinically important, yet data privacy and the cost of expert annotation limit the availability of labeled data. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.

*Weimin Bai,Suzhe Xu,Yiwei Ren,Jinhua Hao,Ming Sun,Wenzheng Chen,He Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstantViR is a real-time video reconstruction framework that distills a bidirectional video diffusion teacher model into a causal autoregressive student model, enabling single-pass inference at over 35 FPS while maintaining high quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video inverse problems need high perceptual quality with low latency for streaming and AR/VR applications. Current diffusion methods either cause temporal artifacts or are too slow for real-time use.

Method: Distillation of bidirectional video diffusion teacher into causal autoregressive student using prior-driven training without external data, plus LeanVAE replacement for efficiency.

Result: Matches or surpasses diffusion baselines in quality while achieving 35+ FPS and up to 100x speedup over iterative methods across inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that diffusion-based video reconstruction can be practical for real-time, interactive, and streaming applications in modern vision systems.

Abstract: Video inverse problems are fundamental to streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR, where high perceptual quality must coexist with tight latency constraints. Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.

Abstract: With the rise in sedentary behavior, health problems caused by poor sitting posture have drawn increasing attention. Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB. Meanwhile, real-time and high-accuracy inference under constrained computational resources was demonstrated on the SV830C + GC030A platform. The proposed approach is characterized by high efficiency, lightweight design and deployability, making it suitable for smart classrooms, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction applications.

*Wenjie Li,Yulun Zhang,Guangwei Gao,Heng Guo,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) for diverse blind face restoration using text-to-image diffusion with measurement constraints to handle the one-to-many nature of low-quality face reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing blind face restoration methods produce deterministic results but fail to capture the multiple plausible high-quality reconstructions possible from extremely low-quality inputs.

Method: Formulates BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task using controlled degradations of coarse restorations, enabling posterior-guided sampling in text-to-image diffusion with Forward and Reverse Measurement constraints.

Result: MCS generates prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed MCS approach successfully enables diverse face reconstructions conditioned on textual prompts while maintaining measurement constraints for alignment with input structures.

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) may correspond to multiple plausible high-quality (HQ) reconstructions under extremely low-quality (LQ) inputs. However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts. Experiments show that our MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods. Codes will be released after acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an autoregressive diffusion model for real-time speech-driven 3D facial animation that processes audio in streaming chunks to handle variable-length inputs with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-conditioned diffusion models for 3D facial animation process entire audio sequences at once, causing poor performance on long sequences and significant latency issues.

Method: The authors developed an autoregressive diffusion model that uses limited past frames as historical motion context combined with audio input to create dynamic conditions for iterative facial motion generation in a streaming manner.

Result: The approach achieves flexibility with varying audio lengths, low latency independent of audio duration, and enables real-time synthesis with high-quality facial animations.

Conclusion: The proposed streaming autoregressive diffusion model effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by enabling real-time, low-latency 3D facial animation that can handle audio sequences of any length.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of speech-driven 3D facial animation, which aims to generate realistic and synchronized facial motions driven by speech inputs.Recent methods have employed audio-conditioned diffusion models for 3D facial animation, achieving impressive results in generating expressive and natural animations.However, these methods process the whole audio sequences in a single pass, which poses two major challenges: they tend to perform poorly when handling audio sequences that exceed the training horizon and will suffer from significant latency when processing long audio inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. We will release the code at https://zju3dv.github.io/StreamingTalker/.

### [73] [Cheating Stereo Matching in Full-scale: Physical Adversarial Attack against Binocular Depth Estimation in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14386)
*Kangqiao Zhao,Shuo Huai,Xurui Song,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models using 3D PAEs with global camouflage texture for visual consistency and attack effectiveness across stereo camera viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attacks use 2D patches targeting monocular perception, leaving stereo-based binocular depth estimation vulnerable and unexplored for physical adversarial examples.

Method: Uses 3D PAE with global camouflage texture, 3D stereo matching rendering module for real-world alignment, and novel merging attack with fine-grained optimization for seamless background integration.

Result: PAEs successfully fool stereo models into producing erroneous depth information with enhanced stealth and lethality compared to existing hiding attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates effective physical adversarial attacks against stereo matching models in autonomous driving contexts, addressing the gap in stereo-based perception vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information.

### [74] [Breaking the Passive Learning Trap: An Active Perception Strategy for Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14237)
*Juncheng Hu,Zijian Zhang,Zeyu Wang,Guoyu Wang,Yingji Li,Kedi Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APS introduces an Active Perceptual Strategy for 3D human motion prediction that uses quotient space representations and auxiliary learning objectives to explicitly encode motion properties and strengthen spatio-temporal modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches rely too heavily on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships, leading to redundant coordinate information acquisition and lacking explicit learning mechanisms. The paper aims to overcome these limitations through active perceptual guidance.

Method: The method includes: 1) A data perception module that projects poses into quotient space to decouple motion geometry from coordinate redundancy using tangent vectors and Grassmann projections; 2) A network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning by masking joints or injecting noise; 3) An auxiliary learning network that adapts to perturbed information.

Result: The method achieves new state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW datasets.

Conclusion: APS provides an effective active perceptual strategy that is model-agnostic and can enhance motion prediction by explicitly encoding motion properties and strengthening spatio-temporal modeling through quotient space representations and auxiliary learning objectives.

Abstract: Forecasting 3D human motion is an important embodiment of fine-grained understanding and cognition of human behavior by artificial agents. Current approaches excessively rely on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into the passive learning trap that results in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for human motion prediction, leveraging quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties while introducing auxiliary learning objectives to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling. Specifically, we first design a data perception module that projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy. By jointly encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, this module simultaneously achieves geometric dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement for effective motion pose characterization. Furthermore, we introduce a network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning. This module deliberately masks specific joints or injects noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals. A dedicated auxiliary learning network is designed to actively adapt and learn from perturbed information. Notably, APS is model agnostic and can be integrated with different prediction models to enhance active perceptual. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods by large margins: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeSTAR is a parameter-efficient framework that enhances foundation models for monocular depth estimation through weakly supervised self-training adaptation with regularization, improving robustness in unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of foundation models in monocular depth estimation when some downstream task data is available, addressing the need for better generalization in diverse and unseen domains.

Method: Uses dense self-training with structural self-supervision, semantically-aware hierarchical normalization using instance-level segmentation, weak supervision via pairwise ordinal depth annotations, and weight regularization to preserve generalizable knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent improvement in generalization and state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks in both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: WeSTAR effectively enhances the robustness of MDE foundation models through parameter-efficient adaptation, achieving superior performance in diverse and challenging domains while maintaining training stability.

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models has substantially advanced zero-shot generalization in monocular depth estimation (MDE), as exemplified by the Depth Anything series. However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI) is a training-free framework that enables iterative video reasoning through a three-phase process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review), structured entity graphs, and open-source model ensembles, achieving competitive performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding methods have limitations: VLMs process videos in single-pass with limited evidence revisit, while agent-based methods depend on expensive proprietary models or extensive RL training. There's a need for more flexible, interpretable approaches that mimic human comprehension.

Method: AVI introduces three innovations: 1) Human-inspired three-phase reasoning (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) for global exploration and local analysis, 2) Structured video knowledge base with entity graphs and multi-granularity tools, 3) Open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight CV models and VLMs.

Result: Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: AVI provides a flexible, training-free framework for video intelligence that eliminates dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training, offering both strong performance and enhanced interpretability through its human-inspired reasoning process.

Abstract: Video understanding requires not only visual recognition but also complex reasoning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNSS-based localization fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult for collaborative perception among multiple agents.

Method: Proposes a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) for pose estimation and Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT) for confidence-aware spatial alignment with temporal context. Also introduces V2VLoc dataset for training and evaluation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions on V2VLoc dataset and demonstrates effectiveness and generalizability on real-world V2V4Real dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides robust collaborative perception in GNSS-denied environments through effective pose confidence estimation and spatio-temporal alignment, validated on both simulation and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Multi-agents rely on accurate poses to share and align observations, enabling a collaborative perception of the environment. However, traditional GNSS-based localization often fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult in collaboration. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task. Extensive experiments conducted on the V2VLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions. We further conduct extended experiments on the real-world V2V4Real dataset to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PASTAT.

Conclusion: ManipBench addresses limitations of existing benchmarks, and ManipShield provides an effective unified solution for manipulation detection, localization, and explanation with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, powerful image editing methods now enable diverse and highly realistic image manipulations that far surpass traditional deepfake techniques, posing new challenges for manipulation detection. Existing image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks suffer from limited content diversity, narrow generative-model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, which hinders the generalization and explanation capabilities of current manipulation detection methods. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection. Building upon ManipBench, we propose \textbf{ManipShield}, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to achieve unified image manipulation detection, localization, and explanation. Extensive experiments on ManipBench and several public datasets demonstrate that ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generality to unseen manipulation models.

*Julia Machnio,Mads Nielsen,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for robust white matter hyperintensity (WMH) segmentation and localization that goes beyond global lesion load to quantify regional WMH distribution, showing regional WMH volumes outperform global burden for disease classification and integrate well with brain atrophy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most automated WMH segmentation methods only provide global lesion load and overlook spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions, despite WMH being key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease, and related dementias.

Method: Proposed a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent ADNI cohort. Quantified WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combined these measures with brain structure volumes.

Result: Predicted lesion loads aligned with reference WMH estimates, confirming robustness to variations. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperformed global lesion burden for disease classification, with AUC values up to 0.97 when integrated with brain atrophy metrics. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, were reproducibly associated with diagnostic status.

Conclusion: Regional WMH quantification provides added value over global measures. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders, indicating localized vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias. Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.

*Yiming Zeng,Xi-Le Zhao,Wei-Hao Wu,Teng-Yu Ji,Chao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GSLR, a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor representation framework that overcomes limitations of traditional t-SVD methods by using 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting to better capture spatial local high-frequency information in multi-dimensional images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional t-SVD methods have two critical limitations: coarse approximation of latent tensors that fails to capture spatial local high-frequency information, and fixed basis atoms in transform matrices that cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along mode-3 fibers.

Method: Proposed GSLR framework uses tailored 2D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the transform matrix. These two components are complementary and provide powerful representation capability for local high-frequency information.

Result: Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery demonstrate that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

Conclusion: GSLR provides a compact and continuous representation for multi-dimensional images that effectively addresses the limitations of traditional t-SVD methods, especially for capturing local high-frequency information.

Abstract: Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) is a promising tool for multi-dimensional image representation, which decomposes a multi-dimensional image into a latent tensor and an accompanying transform matrix. However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery demonstrate that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

TL;DR: A novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework for brain tumor segmentation that handles missing MRI modalities using hierarchical self-distillation and progressive modality combination strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world clinical settings often have missing MRI modalities, which severely compromises deep learning segmentation model performance and generalizability.

Method: Shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture with two self-distillation strategies: hierarchical modality self-distillation to transfer knowledge across modality hierarchies, and progressive modality combination distillation with gradual modality dropout simulation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks, with strong generalization and stability.

Conclusion: CCSD framework effectively addresses the challenge of missing MRI modalities in clinical practice through flexible cross-modal self-distillation strategies.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal MRI is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM3D is a framework that uses large vision-language models as differentiable critics to improve text-to-3D generation by addressing semantic alignment and spatial understanding issues through dual-query guidance signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-3D models struggle with fine-grained semantic details and robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and failures in part assembly and spatial relationships.

Method: Repurposes large vision-language models as differentiable semantic and spatial critics, using dual-query critic signals derived from VLM's Yes/No log-odds to assess both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. Applied as reward objectives for optimization-based pipelines and test-time guidance for feed-forward pipelines.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks for optimization-based pipelines, and actively steers iterative sampling of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors in feed-forward pipelines.

Conclusion: VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable approach to inject VLM's language-grounded understanding of semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has advanced rapidly, yet state-of-the-art models, encompassing both optimization-based and feed-forward architectures, still face two fundamental limitations. First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors. VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject the VLM's rich, language-grounded understanding of both semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

*Nathaniel Putera,Daniel Vilet Rodríguez,Noah Videcrantz,Julia Machnio,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study compares tabular clinical features and transformer-based MRI embeddings for predicting Alzheimer's disease progression, finding complementary strengths: clinical features better identify high-risk extremes while MRI embeddings better detect cognitive stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of Alzheimer's disease cognitive decline is essential for early stratification and personalized management, but tabular predictors have limited ability to capture subtle brain changes.

Method: Used trajectory-aware labeling via Dynamic Time Warping clustering, trained a 3D Vision Transformer via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized MRI data, and compared pretrained encoder embeddings against tabular features and convolutional baselines using both traditional ML classifiers and deep learning heads.

Result: Clinical/volumetric features achieved AUCs around 0.70 for predicting mild/severe progression, while ViT MRI embeddings achieved AUC of 0.71 for distinguishing cognitively stable individuals. All approaches struggled with the heterogeneous moderate group.

Conclusion: Clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, while transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is essential for early stratification and personalized management. While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) using source feature embeddings as codebooks to reconstruct target domain features, enabling fast domain alignment and achieving state-of-the-art performance on 8 CDFSL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the triplet challenges in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning: semantic disjoint, large domain discrepancy, and data scarcity, by creating intermediate domain proxies rather than focusing solely on generalized representations.

Method: Construct Intermediate Domain Proxies using source feature embeddings as codebooks, reconstruct target domain features with these codebooks, and develop a fast domain alignment method using proxies as learning guidance for target feature transformation.

Result: The proposed model surpasses state-of-the-art models by a margin on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks through collaborative learning of intermediate domain reconstruction and target feature transformation.

Conclusion: Intermediate Domain Proxies effectively bridge source and target domains in CDFSL, providing a novel approach that addresses domain discrepancy and data scarcity challenges through feature reconstruction and transformation.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) endeavors to transfer generalized knowledge from the source domain to target domains using only a minimal amount of training data, which faces a triplet of learning challenges in the meantime, i.e., semantic disjoint, large domain discrepancy, and data scarcity. Different from predominant CDFSL works focused on generalized representations, we make novel attempts to construct Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) with source feature embeddings as the codebook and reconstruct the target domain feature with this learned codebook. We then conduct an empirical study to explore the intrinsic attributes from perspectives of visual styles and semantic contents in intermediate domain proxies. Reaping benefits from these attributes of intermediate domains, we develop a fast domain alignment method to use these proxies as learning guidance for target domain feature transformation. With the collaborative learning of intermediate domain reconstruction and target feature transformation, our proposed model is able to surpass the state-of-the-art models by a margin on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuralBoneReg is a self-supervised framework for modality-agnostic bone surface registration in orthopedic surgery, using 3D point clouds and neural unsigned distance fields to achieve robust cross-modal alignment without requiring inter-subject training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In computer-assisted orthopedic surgery, accurate registration between preoperative and intraoperative data is challenging due to modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities, making robust and automatic bone surface registration clinically important.

Method: Proposes NeuralBoneReg with two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field that learns preoperative bone models, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement using transformation hypotheses to align intraoperative point clouds with the neural UDF.

Result: Achieved mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth, matching or surpassing existing methods across all datasets.

Conclusion: NeuralBoneReg demonstrates strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities, providing robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for computer-assisted orthopedic surgery without requiring supervised training data.

Abstract: In computer- and robot-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), patient-specific surgical plans derived from preoperative imaging define target locations and implant trajectories. During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth. These results demonstrate strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities, providing robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for CAOS.

Abstract: Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

TL;DR: Diff-NAF is an iterative framework combining Neural Attenuation Fields with dual-branch conditional diffusion models to address ultra-sparse-view CT reconstruction challenges, progressively enhancing projection completeness and reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-source stationary CT enables rapid reconstruction but suffers from severe quality degradation under ultra-sparse-view sampling conditions where traditional methods fail due to inaccurate interpolation.

Method: Combines Neural Attenuation Field representation with dual-branch conditional diffusion model, using Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis and Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module to iteratively generate and refine projections as pseudo-labels.

Result: Experimental results on simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data show Diff-NAF achieves best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions, progressively enhancing reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: Diff-NAF effectively addresses ultra-sparse-view CT reconstruction challenges through iterative refinement, yielding high-quality reconstructions that outperform traditional methods in sparse-view settings.

Abstract: Multi-source stationary computed tomography (CT) has recently attracted attention for its ability to achieve rapid image reconstruction, making it suitable for time-sensitive clinical and industrial applications. However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dental3R is a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust 3D dental reconstruction from sparse intraoral smartphone photos, addressing challenges like large view baselines, inconsistent lighting, and specular surfaces through intelligent image pairing and wavelet-regularized 3D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional intraoral scanning methods are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which relies on sparse smartphone imagery. Existing 3DGS methods struggle with the clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photos due to large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces, leading to unstable pose estimation and over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details.

Method: Proposes Dental3R with two key components: 1) Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) that selects high-value image pairs for stable geometry initialization and reduced memory usage, and 2) 3DGS training with wavelet-regularized objective using discrete wavelet transform to enforce band-limited fidelity, preserving fine enamel boundaries while suppressing high-frequency artifacts.

Result: Validated on 950 clinical cases and 195 video-based test cases. Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Dental3R provides a robust solution for high-fidelity 3D dental reconstruction from sparse smartphone photos, enabling remote tele-orthodontics by overcoming challenges of conventional methods and improving reconstruction quality while preserving critical diagnostic details.

Abstract: Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: StepsNet is a generalized residual architecture that addresses shortcut degradation and limited width issues in deep networks by separating features along channels and progressively learning through stacked blocks with increasing width.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep residual networks struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements due to shortcut degradation and limited width constraints, calling for more advanced designs to unleash the potential of deeper networks.

Method: Propose StepsNet which separates features along the channel dimension and enables progressive learning through stacking blocks with increasing width, serving as a versatile macro design applicable to various models.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent outperformance over residual models across diverse tasks including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling.

Conclusion: StepsNet serves as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models.

Abstract: Scaling up network depth is a fundamental pursuit in neural architecture design, as theory suggests that deeper models offer exponentially greater capability. Benefiting from the residual connections, modern neural networks can scale up to more than one hundred layers and enjoy wide success. However, as networks continue to deepen, current architectures often struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements, calling for more advanced designs to further unleash the potential of deeper networks. In this paper, we identify two key barriers that obstruct residual models from scaling deeper: shortcut degradation and limited width. Shortcut degradation hinders deep-layer learning, while the inherent depth-width trade-off imposes limited width. To mitigate these issues, we propose a generalized residual architecture dubbed Step by Step Network (StepsNet) to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models. Specifically, we separate features along the channel dimension and let the model learn progressively via stacking blocks with increasing width. The resulting method mitigates the two identified problems and serves as a versatile macro design applicable to various models. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms residual models across diverse tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling. These results position StepsNet as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchMap is a training-free framework for structured dental understanding from 3D intraoral scans, combining geometry-aware arch-flattening with a dental knowledge base for robust tooth analysis without requiring annotated training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep-learning approaches for intraoral 3D scan analysis require modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, limiting generalization and clinical deployment. Raw meshes also have substantial pose variation, incomplete geometry, and lack texture cues.

Method: ArchMap uses a geometry-aware arch-flattening module to standardize raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned multi-view projections, and constructs a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain symbolic reasoning.

Result: Validated on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, ArchMap achieves robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and identifying clinical conditions like crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. It outperforms supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines with higher accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning provides a practical and scalable training-free solution for structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in digital orthodontics.

Abstract: A structured understanding of intraoral 3D scans is essential for digital orthodontics. However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle with real clinical cephalograms due to projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation, leading to convergence failures and anatomically implausible alignments.

Method: Proposes DentalSCR framework with U-Midline Dental Axis for anatomical coordinate system, surface-based DRR with Gaussian splatting for radiograph-like projections, and 2D similarity transform optimized with symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule.

Result: Evaluation on 34 clinical cases shows substantial reductions in landmark error (especially at posterior teeth), tighter dispersion on lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at curve level, outperforming conventional baselines.

Conclusion: DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D-2D alignment, providing a reliable solution for orthodontic diagnosis.

Abstract: Reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scan (IOS) models and lateral cephalometric radiographs is critical for orthodontic diagnosis, yet conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle under real clinical conditions, where cephalograms exhibit projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation. These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.

Abstract: The proliferation of hour-long videos (e.g., lectures, podcasts, documentaries) has intensified demand for efficient content structuring. However, existing approaches are constrained by small-scale training with annotations that are typical short and coarse, restricting generalization to nuanced transitions in long videos. We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations.

TL;DR: Image-Based Gaussian Splatting improves 3DGS by using source images for fine details and view-dependent effects without increasing storage costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with capturing spatially varying colors and view-dependent effects like specular highlights due to limited spherical harmonics, while existing augmentation methods either fail with complex scenes or require excessive storage.

Method: The method models pixel color as a combination of base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual from neighboring training images, enabling accurate surface alignment and high-frequency detail rendering.

Result: Experiments on standard novel view synthesis benchmarks show significant improvement in rendering quality compared to prior Gaussian Splatting approaches.

Conclusion: Image-Based Gaussian Splatting provides an efficient solution for high-quality novel view synthesis with enhanced detail capture and view-dependent effects while maintaining the same storage footprint as standard 3DGS.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a fast, high-quality method for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects. Experiments on standard NVS benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality, without increasing the storage footprint.

TL;DR: JFD3 is an end-to-end framework that jointly performs feature-domain deblurring and detection for infrared UAV targets, using a dual-branch architecture with shared weights where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative features for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared UAV target images often suffer from motion blur that reduces target-background contrast. Existing methods treat deblurring as preprocessing focused on visual quality rather than enhancing task-relevant features for detection.

Method: Dual-branch architecture with shared weights; lightweight feature restoration network using clear branch features as supervision; frequency structure guidance module; feature consistency self-supervised loss between branches.

Result: Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV benchmark (30k simulated + 4,118 real images) show superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.

Conclusion: JFD3 effectively enhances discriminative feature representation for detection under blur conditions through joint feature-domain deblurring and detection in an end-to-end framework.

Abstract: Infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target images often suffer from motion blur degradation caused by rapid sensor movement, significantly reducing contrast between target and background. Generally, detection performance heavily depends on the discriminative feature representation between target and background. Existing methods typically treat deblurring as a preprocessing step focused on visual quality, while neglecting the enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection. Improving feature representation for detection under blur conditions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.

TL;DR: Proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm to automatically assess shoulder pose compliance in biometric documents using 3D shoulder landmarks from pose estimation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: International biometric standards require strict shoulder pose compliance, but existing automated quality assessment methods lack quantitative evaluation for this specific attribute.

Method: Quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks from pose estimation frameworks, evaluated on 121 portrait images.

Result: SPE scores showed strong Pearson correlation (r ≈ 0.80) with human labels, and error-versus-discard analysis confirmed effectiveness in identifying non-compliant samples.

Conclusion: The algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrollment systems.

Abstract: International standards for biometric identity documents mandate strict compliance with pose requirements, including the square presentation of a subject's shoulders. However, the literature on automated quality assessment offers few quantitative methods for evaluating this specific attribute. This paper proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm to address this gap. The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TLS-Assist is a modular redundancy layer that enhances LLM-based autonomous driving agents by providing explicit traffic light and sign recognition, converting detections into natural language messages for the LLM to improve safety and reduce traffic infractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects like traffic lights and signs, creating safety concerns in autonomous driving applications.

Method: TLS-Assist converts traffic light and sign detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups.

Result: Evaluation on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA showed relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions.

Conclusion: TLS-Assist effectively enhances LLM-based autonomous driving agents by providing explicit traffic rule enforcement through structured detection messages, improving both driving performance and safety compliance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making and planning in autonomous driving, showing promising reasoning capabilities and potential to generalize across diverse traffic situations. However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions. We publicly release the code and models on https://github.com/iis-esslingen/TLS-Assist.

*Joachim Tesch,Giorgio Becherini,Prerana Achar,Anastasios Yiannakidis,Muhammed Kocabas,Priyanka Patel,Michael J. Black*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEDLAM2.0 is an improved dataset that addresses the challenge of estimating 3D human motion in world coordinates from video, particularly when both human and camera are moving. It enhances the original BEDLAM dataset with more diverse and realistic cameras, camera motions, body shapes, motions, clothing, hair, 3D environments, and adds shoes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods estimate human motion in image coordinates, but many applications require world coordinate estimation. Progress has been limited by lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement, especially when both human and camera are in motion.

Method: Created BEDLAM2.0 dataset with enhanced diversity and realism: more realistic cameras and camera motions, increased diversity in body shape, motions, clothing, hair, 3D environments, and added shoes (missing in original BEDLAM). Provides rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, camera motions, and 3D assets.

Result: BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. State-of-the-art methods trained on BEDLAM2.0 show significantly better performance compared to those trained on BEDLAM.

Conclusion: BEDLAM2.0 serves as a superior resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors, particularly for world coordinate estimation tasks, and represents a significant advancement over the original BEDLAM dataset.

Abstract: Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM. For research purposes, we provide the rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, and camera motions. We also provide the 3D assets to which we have rights and links to those from third parties.

### [99] [Language as an Anchor: Preserving Relative Visual Geometry for Domain Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14401)
*Shuyi Geng,Tao Zhou,Yi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAVA is a Domain Incremental Learning framework that uses language-based anchors to maintain consistent relative geometry between visual representations across domains, preventing inter-domain interference and knowledge fragmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DIL methods face a dilemma: unified visual spaces cause inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, while isolated domain-specific parameters create knowledge islands that hinder knowledge reuse and cause forgetting.

Method: LAVA replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by text-based reference anchors. It guides visual representations to preserve consistent relative geometry based on pairwise semantic similarities between class names.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks show LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LAVA effectively addresses the DIL challenge by using language-anchored visual alignment to create bridges across domains, enabling knowledge retrieval and robust feature aggregation while avoiding the pitfalls of existing approaches.

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is to continually learn under shifting distributions while preserving knowledge from previous domains. Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating "knowledge islands" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/ShuyiGeng/LAVA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional craniometric landmark localization methods are time-consuming and require expertise, while current automatic methods lack reliability due to insufficient validation. There's a need for more reliable automated approaches in forensic craniofacial identification.

Method: 1) Automatic landmark annotation on 2D skull X-rays using trained YOLO-pose models; 2) Cross-modal matching by converting landmarks into graph representations and finding semantic correspondence between modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework.

Result: The framework demonstrates significant improvements in reliability and accuracy on S2F and CUHK datasets, showing effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching for forensic applications.

Conclusion: Cranio-ID provides a reliable and accurate automated solution for craniometric landmark localization and cross-modal matching, addressing limitations of traditional and current methods in forensic craniofacial identification.

Abstract: In forensic craniofacial identification and in many biomedical applications, craniometric landmarks are important. Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in both reliability and accuracy, as well as its effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CATDiet, a training method that simulates infant visual development by gradually introducing color, sharpness, and temporal continuity, and shows it improves robustness in computer vision models while mirroring biological developmental patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore why human infants experience staged visual development and whether simulating this 'visual diet' can improve machine learning model robustness and biological alignment.

Method: Train self-supervised learning models on object-centric videos under constraints simulating infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T) - collectively called CATDiet. Also develop CombDiet which initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training.

Result: CATDiet variants show enhanced robustness across 10 datasets including corrupted image recognition and depth perception. Models exhibit biologically aligned patterns mirroring macaque V1 development and infant visual cliff responses. CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on object recognition and depth perception.

Conclusion: Early infant visual development progression provides a powerful framework for understanding and improving robust visual intelligence in machines, with staged visual diets offering ecological advantages for learning.

Abstract: Newborns perceive the world with low-acuity, color-degraded, and temporally continuous vision, which gradually sharpens as infants develop. To explore the ecological advantages of such staged "visual diets", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines. All code, data, and models will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light video deblurring is challenging due to dim lighting and long exposures. Existing staged fusion methods are limited against combined low-light and motion blur degradations, requiring a more integrated approach.

Method: CompEvent uses complex-valued neural networks with two core components: Complex Temporal Alignment GRU for temporal alignment and continuous fusion, and Complex Space-Frequency Learning module for unified processing in spatial and frequency domains.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompEvent outperforms state-of-the-art methods in addressing low-light video deblurring challenges.

Conclusion: The proposed CompEvent framework achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability through holistic complex-valued neural network representation.

Abstract: Low-light video deblurring poses significant challenges in applications like nighttime surveillance and autonomous driving due to dim lighting and long exposures. While event cameras offer potential solutions with superior low-light sensitivity and high temporal resolution, existing fusion methods typically employ staged strategies, limiting their effectiveness against combined low-light and motion blur degradations. To overcome this, we propose CompEvent, a complex neural network framework enabling holistic full-process fusion of event data and RGB frames for enhanced joint restoration. CompEvent features two core components: 1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU, which utilizes complex-valued convolutions and processes video and event streams iteratively via GRU to achieve temporal alignment and continuous fusion; and 2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module, which performs unified complex-valued signal processing in both spatial and frequency domains, facilitating deep fusion through spatial structures and system-level characteristics. By leveraging the holistic representation capability of complex-valued neural networks, CompEvent achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompEvent outperforms SOTA methods in addressing this challenging task. The code is available at https://github.com/YuXie1/CompEvent.

TL;DR: A physics-guided deep learning framework that predicts subglacial bed topography by learning residuals over a prior model, using multiple physical constraints and outperforming standard neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radar observations of subglacial bed topography are sparse and uneven, making accurate ice sheet modeling challenging. There's a need for methods that can reconstruct complete bed topography from limited observations while maintaining physical plausibility.

Method: DeepLabV3+ decoder with ResNet-50 encoder trained with physics constraints: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, ramped prior-consistency, and masked Huber fit to radar picks with confidence weighting. Uses residual learning over BedMachine prior.

Result: Achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity across two Greenland sub-regions, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and plain CNN. Produces spatially coherent, physically plausible bed topography suitable for operational mapping under domain shift.

Conclusion: The residual-over-prior design combined with physics constraints enables accurate reconstruction of subglacial bed topography from sparse radar observations, providing a robust solution for ice sheet modeling applications.

Abstract: Accurate subglacial bed topography is essential for ice sheet modeling, yet radar observations are sparse and uneven. We propose a physics-guided residual learning framework that predicts bed thickness residuals over a BedMachine prior and reconstructs bed from the observed surface. A DeepLabV3+ decoder over a standard encoder (e.g.,ResNet-50) is trained with lightweight physics and data terms: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, a ramped prior-consistency term, and a masked Huber fit to radar picks modulated by a confidence map. To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores. Across two Greenland sub-regions, our approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN. The residual-over-prior design, combined with physics, yields spatially coherent, physically plausible beds suitable for operational mapping under domain shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of conventional optimal transport methods that require iterative transport plan computation during training, which slows down the optimization process in computer vision tasks.

Method: Proposes a Gaussian splatting-based approach to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence, computes transport plan using Bayesian probability, and derives a loss function that measures discrepancy after transport for standard network optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on crowd counting and landmark detection tasks validate the effectiveness of GST, showing it eliminates the need for iterative transport plan computation during training while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: GST provides an efficient alternative to conventional optimal transport schemes by leveraging Gaussian splatting for transport plan computation, significantly improving training efficiency without sacrificing performance in computer vision tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian Spatial Transport (GST), a novel framework that leverages Gaussian splatting to facilitate transport from the probability measure in the image coordinate space to the annotation map. We propose a Gaussian splatting-based method to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence, which is then used to compute a transport plan derived from Bayesian probability. To integrate the resulting transport plan into standard network optimization in typical computer vision tasks, we derive a loss function that measures discrepancy after transport. Extensive experiments on representative computer vision tasks, including crowd counting and landmark detection, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to conventional optimal transport schemes, GST eliminates iterative transport plan computation during training, significantly improving efficiency.

TL;DR: SEED-SR is a novel approach that uses conditional latent diffusion models and geo-spatial foundation models to perform super-resolution in a segmentation-aware latent space, enabling 20× scale factor improvements for farm boundary delineation from satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reference-based super-resolution methods fail for smallholder farm delineation because they optimize for perceptual quality rather than preserving crucial features needed for segmentation, and cannot handle the large scale factors required. Two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation also don't effectively utilize diverse satellite sources.

Method: The approach bypasses explicit pixel-space super-resolution and instead performs SR in a segmentation-aware latent space using conditional latent diffusion models combined with large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models.

Result: The method achieves unprecedented 20× scale factor and demonstrates 25.5% relative improvement in instance segmentation and 12.9% relative improvement in semantic segmentation metrics over state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods on two large real datasets.

Conclusion: SEED-SR successfully addresses the limitations of current methods by performing super-resolution in a segmentation-aware latent space, enabling accurate farm boundary delineation at large scale factors for agricultural monitoring applications.

Abstract: Delineating farm boundaries through segmentation of satellite images is a fundamental step in many agricultural applications. The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\textbf{25.5}$ and $\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.

TL;DR: RSD is a framework that uses Vision-Language Models to enhance End-to-End autonomous driving systems by distilling risk attention into BEV features, improving generalization in complex driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems struggle with generalization to unseen scenarios and sensor configurations. While VLMs show promise for few-shot/zero-shot tasks, they create hybrid systems with potential inconsistencies, and VLA frameworks have prohibitive computational demands.

Method: Introduces Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD) with RiskHead module that distills causal risk estimates from VLMs into Bird's-Eye-View features, creating interpretable risk-attention maps that enhance BEV representations.

Result: Experiments on Bench2Drive benchmark show significant improvements in both perception and planning capabilities, with enhanced ability to handle complex and unpredictable driving conditions.

Conclusion: RSD effectively addresses generalization issues in autonomous driving by leveraging VLMs to provide risk attention, enabling richer BEV representations that align with human-like driving behavior for better navigation in dynamic environments.

Abstract: The autonomous driving (AD) system has exhibited remarkable performance in complex driving scenarios. However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use convolutions and attention for task interactions, but lack effective modeling of holistic task relationships in multi-task dense prediction scenarios.

Method: Leverages state space models with dual parameter experts for task-specific priors, uses structured state space sequence model (S4) for global integration, and employs Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning for 2D feature sequence construction.

Result: Extensive experiments on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in multi-task dense prediction.

Conclusion: PAMM provides an effective framework for enhancing task interconnectivity in multi-task learning through parameter-aware state space modeling and improved 2D feature perception.

Abstract: Understanding the inter-relations and interactions between tasks is crucial for multi-task dense prediction. Existing methods predominantly utilize convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to explore task-level interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel decoder-based framework, Parameter Aware Mamba Model (PAMM), specifically designed for dense prediction in multi-task learning setting. Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4). Furthermore, we employ the Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning method to construct multi-angle feature sequences, thereby enhancing the sequence model's perceptual capabilities for 2D data. Extensive experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/CQC-gogopro/PAMM.

TL;DR: D-PerceptCT is a novel LDCT enhancement method inspired by human visual system principles, using semantic-aware feature extraction and global-local processing to preserve diagnostically important details while reducing noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDCT reduces radiation risk but degrades image quality, causing loss of critical diagnostic details. Existing methods often over-smooth images and remove important features needed for radiological diagnosis.

Method: D-PerceptCT combines: 1) Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex) integrating DINOv2 semantic priors with local features, 2) Global-Local State-Space block for long-range and multiscale feature capture, and 3) Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF) based on human contrast sensitivity.

Result: Extensive experiments on Mayo2016 dataset show D-PerceptCT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving structural and textural information in LDCT images while effectively reducing noise.

Conclusion: The HVS-inspired D-PerceptCT framework successfully enhances LDCT images by preserving perceptually relevant features critical for diagnosis, providing radiologists with improved visualization of anatomical structures and pathological details.

Abstract: Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is widely used as an imaging solution to aid diagnosis and other clinical tasks. However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using in-air natural images as reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions to create synthetic datasets for underwater image restoration, overcoming the limitation of scarce high-quality paired datasets in this field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for underwater image restoration are constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets, as obtaining pristine reference labels in underwater scenes is difficult. Existing benchmarks often use manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision.

Method: The authors establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset covering 6 representative underwater degradation types. This framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels that facilitate learning accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to pristine scene appearances.

Result: Extensive experiments across 6 network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on the synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance compared to models trained on existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The research provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement by creating synthetic datasets that offer authentic supervision signals for model learning, with the generated dataset being publicly available.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration and enhancement are crucial for correcting color distortion and restoring image details, thereby establishing a fundamental basis for subsequent underwater visual tasks. However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks. This research provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement. The generated dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/yftian2025/SynUIEDatasets.git.

*Xiangchen Yin,Jiahui Yuan,Zhangchi Hu,Wenzhang Sun,Jie Chen,Xiaozhen Qiao,Hao Li,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeCo-VAE proposes a decoupled VAE framework that separates video content into keyframe, motion, and residual components with dedicated encoders to achieve compact latent representation and reduce redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video VAEs overlook similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling and inefficient representation of video data.

Method: Decompose video content into keyframe, motion, and residual components; use dedicated encoders for each component with shared 3D decoder; employ decoupled adaptation strategy with sequential training of partial encoders while freezing others.

Result: Extensive experiments show DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed decoupled VAE framework effectively addresses redundancy in video latent modeling and achieves compact representation through explicit component separation and dedicated encoding.

Abstract: Existing video Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) generally overlook the similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling. In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation. Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance.

### [112] [Learning Compact Latent Space for Representing Neural Signed Distance Functions with High-fidelity Geometry Details](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14539)
*Qiang Bai,Bojian Wu,Xi Yang,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to represent multiple neural signed distance functions (SDFs) in a common space, overcoming limitations of existing approaches by combining generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural SDFs work well for single shapes/scenes but struggle with multiple SDFs due to limited latent space information and loss of geometry details. Existing methods face obstacles in analyzing multiple SDFs while maintaining high-fidelity geometry.

Method: The approach represents multiple SDFs in a common space by combining generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies. It also introduces a novel sampling strategy for training queries to improve efficiency and eliminate artifacts from other SDFs' influence.

Result: The method shows advantages over latest approaches in both numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks, demonstrating improved representative ability and compactness while recovering more high-fidelity geometry details.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of neural SDFs for multiple shapes by leveraging combined learning strategies and efficient sampling, achieving superior performance in preserving geometry details with compact latent representations.

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have been a vital representation to represent 3D shapes or scenes with neural networks. An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for modeling hand-object interactions using 3D Gaussian Splatting without object priors, featuring interaction-aware representations and progressive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging problem of simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance in hand-object interaction scenes without relying on object priors, particularly handling mutual occlusion, edge blur, and complex dynamics.

Method: Uses interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with optimizable parameters for structural representation, incorporates hand information into object deformation fields, employs progressive optimization strategy, and applies explicit regularizations for motion stability and physical reality.

Result: The approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles complex hand-object interactions with mutual occlusion and motion dynamics, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: This paper focuses on a challenging setting of simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance of hand-object interaction scenes without any object priors. We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.

Abstract: Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders severely threaten information integrity and societal stability. Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: The clustering approach offers superior model explainability for digital pathology, bridging the gap between technical performance and clinical trustworthiness.

Abstract: We present a clustering-based explainability technique for digital pathology models based on convolutional neural networks. Unlike commonly used methods based on saliency maps, such as occlusion, GradCAM, or relevance propagation, which highlight regions that contribute the most to the prediction for a single slide, our method shows the global behaviour of the model under consideration, while also providing more fine-grained information. The result clusters can be visualised not only to understand the model, but also to increase confidence in its operation, leading to faster adoption in clinical practice. We also evaluate the performance of our technique on an existing model for detecting prostate cancer, demonstrating its usefulness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniZip is a training-free framework that compresses audio-video tokens in Omnimodal LLMs using audio-guided pruning, achieving 3.42X speedup and 1.4X memory reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Processing audio-video token sequences creates computational bottlenecks in Omnimodal LLMs, and existing token compression methods don't address the need for joint multimodal token compression.

Method: OmniZip identifies salient audio tokens, computes audio retention scores for time groups, dynamically guides video token pruning using cross-modal similarity, and compresses video tokens with interleaved spatio-temporal scheme.

Result: Achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction compared to other top-performing methods while maintaining performance without training.

Conclusion: OmniZip effectively bridges the gap in multimodal token compression, offering significant computational efficiency improvements for audio-video understanding in Omnimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models (OmniLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention of late towards unified audio-video understanding, wherein processing audio-video token sequences creates a significant computational bottleneck, however. Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach with cross-attention fusion effectively improves femoral neck BMD estimation, showing potential for real-world clinical applications in osteoporosis screening and bone health assessment.

Abstract: Poor bone health is a significant public health concern, and low bone mineral density (BMD) leads to an increased fracture risk, a key feature of osteoporosis. We present XAttn-BMD (Cross-Attention BMD), a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts femoral neck BMD from hip X-ray images and structured clinical metadata. It utilizes a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate image and metadata features for cross-modal mutual reinforcement. A Weighted Smooth L1 loss is tailored to address BMD imbalance and prioritize clinically significant cases. Extensive experiments on the data from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study show that our model outperforms the baseline models in regression generalization and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both cross-attention fusion and the customized loss function. Experimental results show that the integration of multimodal data via cross-attention outperforms naive feature concatenation without cross-attention, reducing MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increasing the R2 score by 16.4%, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach for femoral neck BMD estimation. Furthermore, screening performance was evaluated using binary classification at clinically relevant femoral neck BMD thresholds, demonstrating the model's potential in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: HoloTea is a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E histology while leveraging information from adjacent sections, enabling scalable and accurate 3D tissue transcriptomics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for inferring spatial transcriptomics from histology either treat sections independently (ignoring 3D structure) or are not generative and don't scale well. There's a need for scalable 3D-aware approaches that can create holistic tissue transcriptomics profiles.

Method: Uses a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that retrieves morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in shared feature space, fuses cross-section context via lightweight ControlNet, and employs a 3D-consistent prior combining learned ZINB prior with spatial-empirical prior from neighboring sections. Includes global attention block for linear scaling with spot count.

Result: Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to both 2D and 3D baseline methods.

Conclusion: HoloTea advances the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, which can accelerate biomarker discovery and deepen understanding of disease by providing scalable and robust 3D tissue transcriptomics profiles.

Abstract: A scalable and robust 3D tissue transcriptomics profile can enable a holistic understanding of tissue organization and provide deeper insights into human biology and disease. Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines. We envision HoloTea advancing the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, ultimately accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening our understanding of disease.

*Md Fokhrul Islam,Sajeda Al-Hammouri,Christopher J. Arellano,Kavan Hazeli,Heman Shakeri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BioST-GCN model combines pose and biomechanical data using cross-attention fusion to predict falls, achieving 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score improvements over baseline on simulated datasets, but faces significant simulation-reality gap with performance dropping from 89.0% to 35.9% in zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Falls are a major cause of injury and loss of independence in older adults, and vision-based fall prediction systems are limited by scarce real fall data. The study aims to address this gap by developing a more effective fall prediction model.

Method: Proposed Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN) - a dual-stream model combining pose and biomechanical information using cross-attention fusion mechanism, with spatio-temporal attention for interpretability.

Result: Model outperforms vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on MCF-UA and MUVIM datasets respectively. Achieves 89.0% F1-score on simulated data but drops to 35.9% in zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects, revealing significant simulation-reality gap.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data. Proposed personalization strategies and privacy-preserving data pipelines for real-world validation to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.

Abstract: Falls are a leading cause of injury and loss of independence among older adults. Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Splatting methods for scene geometry reconstruction suffer from overfitting when input views are sparse, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality and degraded novel view synthesis performance due to increased anisotropy in flattened Gaussians.

Method: The method introduces Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment to bridge rendering quality and geometry estimation, and presents Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency using both training and unseen views to mitigate overfitting.

Result: Extensive experiments on DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance in surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the overfitting problem in sparse-view Gaussian Splatting, enabling more accurate surface reconstruction while maintaining high-quality novel view rendering through joint optimization of geometry and texture alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks in computational cytology, particularly beneficial for low witness rate scenarios.

Abstract: Computational cytology faces two major challenges: i) instance-level labels are unreliable and prohibitively costly to obtain, ii) witness rates are extremely low. We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks.

Result: Outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based approaches (Bronchinet, NaviAirway) on both voxel-level and topological metrics across two datasets (ATM'22 and AeroPath), producing more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees.

Conclusion: RepAir provides robust airway segmentation that maintains high accuracy while addressing the critical issue of disconnected components through anatomically informed topology correction.

Abstract: Accurate airway segmentation from chest computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for quantitative lung analysis, yet manual annotation is impractical and many automated U-Net-based methods yield disconnected components that hinder reliable biomarker extraction. We present RepAir, a three-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines an nnU-Net-based network with anatomically informed topology correction. The segmentation network produces an initial airway mask, after which a skeleton-based algorithm identifies potential discontinuities and proposes reconnections. A 1D convolutional classifier then determines which candidate links correspond to true anatomical branches versus false or obstructed paths. We evaluate RepAir on two distinct datasets: ATM'22, comprising annotated CT scans from predominantly healthy subjects and AeroPath, encompassing annotated scans with severe airway pathology. Across both datasets, RepAir outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based approaches such as Bronchinet and NaviAirway on both voxel-level and topological metrics, and produces more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.

### [123] [Signature vs. Substance: Evaluating the Balance of Adversarial Resistance and Linguistic Quality in Watermarking Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13722)
*William Guo,Adaku Uchendu,Ana Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Watermarking techniques for LLM-generated text negatively affect text quality and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks like paraphrasing and back translation, which can remove watermarks and evade detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To encourage wider adoption of watermarking by LLM creators by evaluating its robustness against adversarial attacks and its impact on text quality and writing style.

Method: Evaluated several watermarking techniques by comparing their robustness to paraphrasing and back translation attacks, and used linguistic metrics to assess quality and writing style preservation compared to unwatermarked texts.

Result: Watermarking techniques preserve semantics but deviate from the writing style of unwatermarked texts and are susceptible to adversarial attacks, particularly back translation attacks.

Conclusion: Current watermarking techniques have limitations in preserving writing style and robustness against attacks, highlighting the need for improved methods to encourage adoption by LLM creators.

Abstract: To mitigate the potential harms of Large Language Models (LLMs)generated text, researchers have proposed watermarking, a process of embedding detectable signals within text. With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts. However, recent findings suggest that these techniques often negatively affect the quality of the generated texts, and adversarial attacks can strip the watermarking signals, causing the texts to possibly evade detection. These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\to$ another language $\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts. Our results suggest that these watermarking techniques preserve semantics, deviate from the writing style of the unwatermarked texts, and are susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially for the back translation attack.

### [125] [Can QE-informed (Re)Translation lead to Error Correction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13884)
*Govardhan Padmanabhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents two training-free approaches for QE-informed segment-level error correction: QE-informed Retranslation (selecting best translation from multiple LLM candidates) and QE-guided substring replacement, with the former achieving better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While joint training of QE and APE systems improves performance, APE systems still overcorrect MT outputs, degrading performance. The authors investigate training-free alternatives to avoid this issue.

Method: Two training-free approaches: 1) QE-informed Retranslation - selecting highest-quality translation from multiple LLM candidates, 2) QE-guided substring replacement - instructing LLM to replace error substrings based on QE explanations with conditional heuristic to minimize edits.

Result: The first approach achieved Delta COMET score of 0.0201, while the second approach scored -0.0108. The QE-informed Retranslation approach won the WMT 2025 Task 3 leaderboard.

Conclusion: Training-free QE-informed approaches can effectively correct MT errors without the overcorrection problems of traditional APE systems, with candidate selection outperforming direct error correction.

Abstract: The paper presents two approaches submitted to the WMT 2025 Automated Translation Quality Evaluation Systems Task 3 - Quality Estimation (QE)-informed Segment-level Error Correction. While jointly training QE systems with Automatic Post-Editing (APE) has shown improved performance for both tasks, APE systems are still known to overcorrect the output of Machine Translation (MT), leading to a degradation in performance. We investigate a simple training-free approach - QE-informed Retranslation, and compare it with another within the same training-free paradigm. Our winning approach selects the highest-quality translation from multiple candidates generated by different LLMs. The second approach, more akin to APE, instructs an LLM to replace error substrings as specified in the provided QE explanation(s). A conditional heuristic was employed to minimise the number of edits, with the aim of maximising the Gain-to-Edit ratio. The two proposed approaches achieved a Delta COMET score of 0.0201 and -0.0108, respectively, leading the first approach to achieve the winning position on the subtask leaderboard.

*Mihir Gupte,Eshan Dixit,Muhammad Tayyab,Arun Adiththan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GM-Extract, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to retrieve control variables, revealing that data representation in context windows significantly impacts retrieval performance, and finds nuanced effectiveness of mitigation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the 'lost-in-the-middle' phenomenon where LLMs struggle with long-range context in retrieval applications, particularly for control variable extraction in real-world settings.

Method: Created GM-Extract benchmark with two metrics (Document and Variable Extraction), systematically evaluated 7-8B parameter models on multi-document tasks, analyzed performance patterns with perplexity correlations, and tested categorized mitigation methods (black-box and white-box).

Result: Found significant performance changes based on data representation in context windows, clear performance patterns across models correlated with perplexity, and nuanced effectiveness of mitigation methods - some improved performance while others had negative impacts.

Conclusion: The study provides comprehensive understanding of LLM retrieval limitations and mitigation strategies in practical contexts, highlighting that solution effectiveness is highly dependent on specific scenarios and data representations.

Abstract: The diminishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to effectively utilize long-range context-the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon-poses a significant challenge in retrieval-based LLM applications. To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods. We then apply these techniques to our benchmark, finding that their efficacy is highly nuanced. Our evaluation highlights scenarios where these strategies successfully improve performance, as well as surprising cases where they lead to a negative impact, providing a comprehensive understanding of their utility in a practical context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can interpret superlative expressions in e-commerce queries by extracting structured hints, improving search performance by 10.9 MAP points and ranking by 5.9 MRR points, with an efficient transfer approach to lightweight models for practical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search queries with superlatives require complex multi-dimensional comparisons that need both linguistic understanding and domain knowledge, but current systems struggle with interpreting these latent intents effectively.

Method: A framework that decomposes superlative queries into attribute-value hints generated concurrently with retrieval, enabling efficient integration into ranking pipelines, and transferring these interpretations to lightweight models to overcome LLM latency issues.

Result: Significant improvements in search performance: 10.9 points increase in Mean Average Precision (MAP) and 5.9 points increase in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The approach successfully represents and transfers superlative semantics between models, advancing linguistic interpretation in retrieval systems while addressing practical deployment constraints like latency.

Abstract: Search queries with superlatives (e.g., best, most popular) require comparing candidates across multiple dimensions, demanding linguistic understanding and domain knowledge. We show that LLMs can uncover latent intent behind these expressions in e-commerce queries through a framework that extracts structured interpretations or hints. Our approach decomposes queries into attribute-value hints generated concurrently with retrieval, enabling efficient integration into the ranking pipeline. Our method improves search performanc eby 10.9 points in MAP and ranking by 5.9 points in MRR over baselines. Since direct LLM-based reranking faces prohibitive latency, we develop an efficient approach transferring superlative interpretations to lightweight models. Our findings provide insights into how superlative semantics can be represented and transferred between models, advancing linguistic interpretation in retrieval systems while addressing practical deployment constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoRA-RAG is a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms unstructured post-disaster reconnaissance reports into structured knowledge for multi-hazard reasoning, achieving 94.5% accuracy and significantly reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-disaster reconnaissance reports contain critical evidence for understanding multi-hazard interactions but are unstructured, making systematic knowledge transfer difficult. LLMs can analyze these reports but often generate unreliable outputs without proper domain grounding.

Method: The framework integrates Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases, uses agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence, and includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency and refines queries when information is incomplete.

Result: MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5% accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30% and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10%, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. It also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models.

Conclusion: MoRA-RAG establishes a new paradigm for transforming post-disaster documentation into actionable, trustworthy intelligence for hazard resilience.

Abstract: Post-disaster reconnaissance reports contain critical evidence for understanding multi-hazard interactions, yet their unstructured narratives make systematic knowledge transfer difficult. Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent. This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning. The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types. MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5 percent accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30 percent and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10 percent, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. MoRA-RAG also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models. It establishes a new paradigm for transforming post-disaster documentation into actionable, trustworthy intelligence for hazard resilience.

*Junjie Wu,Yumeng Fu,Nan Yu,Guohong Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiEAG is a hierarchical framework that enhances multimodal misinformation detection by checking external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence using MLLMs, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOC misinformation detection methods focus on internal consistency but ignore external consistency with external evidence, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes HiEAG framework with evidence reranking (AESP) and rewriting (AEGP) modules, leveraging MLLMs to decompose external consistency checking into retrieval, reranking, and rewriting pipeline.

Result: Experimental results show HiEAG surpasses previous SOTA methods in accuracy across different benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HiEAG effectively addresses external consistency checking in multimodal misinformation detection and achieves superior performance through hierarchical evidence-augmented generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation detection have made remarkable progress in checking the consistencies between different modalities for supporting or refuting image-text pairs. However, existing OOC misinformation detection methods tend to emphasize the role of internal consistency, ignoring the significant of external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence. In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning. Experimental results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiEAG surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the accuracy over all samples.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses class imbalance in multi-label sentiment classification by creating a balanced dataset combining GoEmotions, Sentiment140, and GPT-4 generated texts, and develops an enhanced model with FastText embeddings, CNN, BiLSTM, and attention mechanisms that significantly outperforms models trained on imbalanced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-label sentiment datasets like GoEmotions suffer from severe class imbalance, which hampers model performance particularly for underrepresented emotions, creating a need for balanced datasets and improved classification approaches.

Method: Constructed a balanced multi-label sentiment dataset by integrating GoEmotions data, emotion-labeled samples from Sentiment140 using RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions model, and manually annotated GPT-4 mini generated texts. Developed an enhanced classification model combining FastText embeddings, convolutional layers, bidirectional LSTM, attention mechanism, and sigmoid-activated output layer with mixed precision training.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC compared to models trained on imbalanced data, validating the effectiveness of the balanced dataset and enhanced model architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed approach of creating balanced multi-label sentiment datasets and using enhanced classification models with attention mechanisms effectively addresses class imbalance issues and significantly improves multi-label sentiment classification performance across all evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Multi-label sentiment classification plays a vital role in natural language processing by detecting multiple emotions within a single text. However, existing datasets like GoEmotions often suffer from severe class imbalance, which hampers model performance, especially for underrepresented emotions. To address this, we constructed a balanced multi-label sentiment dataset by integrating the original GoEmotions data, emotion-labeled samples from Sentiment140 using a RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions model, and manually annotated texts generated by GPT-4 mini. Our data balancing strategy ensured an even distribution across 28 emotion categories. Based on this dataset, we developed an enhanced multi-label classification model that combines pre-trained FastText embeddings, convolutional layers for local feature extraction, bidirectional LSTM for contextual learning, and an attention mechanism to highlight sentiment-relevant words. A sigmoid-activated output layer enables multi-label prediction, and mixed precision training improves computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC compared to models trained on imbalanced data, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Stealth Fine-Tuning is a novel attack method that bypasses safety alignment in Reasoning-augmented Vision-Language Models (RVLMs) by using segment-level interference to generate harmful reasoning traces and reusing them as fine-tuning data, achieving high attack success rates while preserving general reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RVLMs rely on safety alignment to prevent harmful behavior, but their exposed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces create new attack surfaces that can be exploited to bypass these safety measures.

Method: The approach uses segment-level interference to elicit harmful reasoning traces, reuses self-generated outputs as supervised fine-tuning data, and employs a turn-based weighted loss design for lightweight, distribution-consistent fine-tuning using QLoRA.

Result: With only 499 samples and under 3 hours on a single A100, Stealth Fine-Tuning outperforms IDEATOR by 38.52% Attack Success Rate (ASR) while preserving general reasoning ability and maintaining the original representation distribution.

Conclusion: Stealth Fine-Tuning is a low-cost, highly effective method to bypass alignment defenses in RVLMs, demonstrating significant vulnerabilities in current safety alignment approaches.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented Vision-Language Models (RVLMs) rely on safety alignment to prevent harmful behavior, yet their exposed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces introduce new attack surfaces. In this work, we find that the safety alignment of RVLMs can be easily break through a novel attack method termed \textbf{Stealth Fine-Tuning}. Our method elicits harmful reasoning traces through \textbf{segment-level interference} and reuses the self-generated outputs as supervised fine-tuning data. Through a \textbf{turn-based weighted} loss design, yielding a lightweight, distribution-consistent finetuning method. In our experiment, with only 499 samples and under 3 hours on a single A100 (QLoRA), Stealth Fine-Tuning outperforms IDEATOR by 38.52\% ASR while preserving general reasoning ability, as the tuned model retains the original representation distribution. Experiments on AdvBench and several general benchmarks demonstrate that Stealth Fine-Tuning is a low-cost and highly effective way to bypass alignment defenses. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Disclaimer: This paper contains content that may be disturbing or offensive.}}

TL;DR: This paper proposes a data-centric framework that generates synthetic discharge summaries to address the long-tail distribution problem in ICD coding, improving rare code prediction while maintaining overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic ICD coding from clinical text faces challenges due to extreme long-tail distribution of diagnostic codes, where thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores.

Method: The authors construct realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes using real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. They generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes using structured prompts to expand the training distribution.

Result: Fine-tuning two state-of-the-art transformer models (PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD) on both original and extended datasets shows modest improvements in macro-F1 while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Carefully crafted synthetic data can enhance equity in long-tail ICD code prediction, demonstrating that data-centric approaches can mitigate imbalance issues in medical NLP tasks despite the computational cost.

TL;DR: HyperABSA is a dynamic hypergraph framework for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis that uses hierarchical clustering to create sample-specific aspect-opinion structures, outperforming previous graph-based methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based ABSA approaches model only pairwise dependencies, requiring multiple graphs for different relational views which introduces redundancy, parameter overhead, and error propagation, especially problematic for short texts and low-resource settings.

Method: Proposes HyperABSA with dynamic hypergraph construction using sample-specific hierarchical clustering and a novel acceleration-fallback cutoff mechanism to adaptively determine granularity levels for hyperedge formation.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks (Lap14, Rest14, MAMS) show consistent improvements over strong graph baselines, with substantial gains when paired with RoBERTa backbones.

Conclusion: Dynamic hypergraph construction is an efficient and powerful alternative for ABSA with potential extensions to other short-text NLP tasks.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) predicts sentiment polarity for specific aspect terms, a task made difficult by conflicting sentiments across aspects and the sparse context of short texts. Prior graph-based approaches model only pairwise dependencies, forcing them to construct multiple graphs for different relational views. These introduce redundancy, parameter overhead, and error propagation during fusion, limiting robustness in short-text, low-resource settings. We present HyperABSA, a dynamic hypergraph framework that induces aspect-opinion structures through sample-specific hierarchical clustering. To construct these hyperedges, we introduce a novel acceleration-fallback cutoff for hierarchical clustering, which adaptively determines the level of granularity. Experiments on three benchmarks (Lap14, Rest14, MAMS) show consistent improvements over strong graph baselines, with substantial gains when paired with RoBERTa backbones. These results position dynamic hypergraph construction as an efficient, powerful alternative for ABSA, with potential extensions to other short-text NLP tasks.

*Naoki Shimoda,Akihiro Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method that combines Transformer-based relation extraction with knowledge graph matching to answer multiple-choice questions while maintaining traceability of the reasoning process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the capability of Transformer-based relation extraction to dynamically generate knowledge graphs from natural language texts, enabling representation of sentence meaning and addressing the challenge that relation extraction methods can generate false information from factually incorrect texts.

Method: The method answers fill-in-the-blank MCQs by: (i) converting question sentences into relational graphs using relation extraction, and (ii) verifying these graphs against factually correct knowledge graphs under the closed-world assumption to measure truthfulness.

Result: Experimental results show the method correctly answers up to around 70% of questions while providing traceability, with question category having a significant influence on accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines dynamic knowledge graph generation with verification against factual knowledge bases to answer multiple-choice questions with traceable reasoning, though performance varies considerably by question type.

Abstract: In this research, we combine Transformer-based relation extraction with matching of knowledge graphs (KGs) and apply them to answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs) while maintaining the traceability of the output process. KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the "fill-in-the-blank" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure. We also highlight that the question category has a vast influence on the accuracy.

TL;DR: Proposes a selective weak-to-strong generalization framework that avoids unnecessary weak supervision by using a classifier to identify questions the strong model can answer, and refines weak labels with graph smoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Future superhuman models will surpass human ability, making only weak supervision possible. Existing weak-to-strong generalization methods use weak supervision indiscriminately, which can be harmful to models when weak labels are poor quality.

Method: Train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions the strong model can answer, using self-generated labels for alignment. Refine weak labels with graph smoothing method.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show consistent outperformance over competitive baselines. P(IK) classifier generalizes across tasks and difficulties.

Conclusion: Selective weak-to-strong generalization can help superalignment by avoiding harmful weak supervision and leveraging the strong model's own capabilities.

Abstract: Future superhuman models will surpass the ability of humans and humans will only be able to \textit{weakly} supervise superhuman models. To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses show that P(IK) can generalize across tasks and difficulties, which indicates selective W2SG can help superalignment.

### [136] [SymLoc: Symbolic Localization of Hallucination across HaluEval and TruthfulQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14172)
*Naveen Lamba,Sanju Tiwari,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a symbolic localization framework to trace hallucination development in LLMs, revealing that symbolic triggers cause attention variance explosions in early layers and that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with hallucination triggered by symbolic elements like modifiers, negation, and named entities, but current localization methods overlook the role of symbolic linguistic knowledge in triggering these failures.

Method: Developed a symbolic localization framework using symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to trace hallucination development across model layers, analyzing five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA with focus on symbolic triggers.

Result: Attention variance for symbolic linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels. Hallucination rates remain high (78.3%-83.7%) across Gemma variants despite larger model sizes, with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers in deeper layers.

Conclusion: Hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure rather than a general generation problem, and symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.

Abstract: LLMs still struggle with hallucination, especially when confronted with symbolic triggers like modifiers, negation, numbers, exceptions, and named entities. Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepEL is a comprehensive framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) throughout all stages of entity linking, featuring a novel self-validation mechanism that uses global context to improve entity disambiguation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous LLM-based approaches only applied LLMs to isolated stages of entity linking, failing to fully leverage their capabilities across the entire process. Additionally, disambiguating entities in isolation was found to be insufficient for optimal performance.

Method: DeepEL incorporates LLMs into every stage of entity linking and introduces a self-validation mechanism that utilizes global contextual information, allowing LLMs to correct their own predictions and better understand cohesive relationships among entities within sentences.

Result: Extensive evaluation across ten benchmark datasets shows DeepEL substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 2.6% average F1 improvement overall and 4% gain on out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: Deep integration of LLMs throughout the entity linking pipeline, combined with self-validation using global context, significantly advances the state-of-the-art in entity linking performance.

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL), the task of mapping textual entity mentions to their corresponding entries in knowledge bases, constitutes a fundamental component of natural language understanding. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for enhancing EL performance. Prior research has leveraged LLMs to improve entity disambiguation and input representation, yielding significant gains in accuracy and robustness. However, these approaches typically apply LLMs to isolated stages of the EL task, failing to fully integrate their capabilities throughout the entire process.
  In this work, we introduce DeepEL, a comprehensive framework that incorporates LLMs into every stage of the entity linking task. Furthermore, we identify that disambiguating entities in isolation is insufficient for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel self-validation mechanism that utilizes global contextual information, enabling LLMs to rectify their own predictions and better recognize cohesive relationships among entities within the same sentence.
  Extensive empirical evaluation across ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that DeepEL substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.6\% in overall F1 score and a remarkable 4% gain on out-of-domain datasets. These results underscore the efficacy of deep LLM integration in advancing the state-of-the-art in entity linking.

TL;DR: ArbESC+ is a multi-system approach for Arabic grammatical error correction that combines multiple models (AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, etc.) to generate correction proposals, uses numerical features and a classifier to select appropriate corrections, and achieves state-of-the-art results on QALB datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic has complex morphological and syntactic structure making GEC challenging, and previous approaches used individual models without leveraging the benefits of combining different systems.

Method: Multiple models generate correction proposals represented as numerical features, a classifier selects appropriate corrections, with support techniques for filtering overlapping corrections and estimating decision reliability.

Result: Achieved F0.5 scores of 82.63% on QALB-14, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2, outperforming single-model approaches.

Conclusion: This is the first Arabic attempt to integrate linguistic error correction through multi-system combination, providing a practical advancement for Arabic text processing tools.

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is an important aspect of natural language processing. Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing.

*Kai Tian,Yirong Mao,Wendong Bi,Hanjie Wang,Que Wenhui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for improving large language models in the music domain through domain-specific data construction, quality control mechanisms, and evaluation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models perform well on general tasks but struggle in specialized domains like music due to limitations in corpus scale, purity, and data-task alignment.

Method: Constructed a 40B token music corpus using open-source and in-house data with domain-first pipeline including filtering, cleaning, deduplication, and privacy masking. Introduced reference-model based token-level soft scoring for quality control and dynamic down-weighting during optimization.

Result: Developed a scalable data-training framework and created the MusicSimpleQA benchmark for automated factuality assessment in the music domain.

Conclusion: The work advances both corpus construction and training objectives, providing a reusable framework and evaluation tool for building domain-specific LLMs in music.

Abstract: Large language models perform strongly on general tasks but remain constrained in specialized settings such as music, particularly in the music-entertainment domain, where corpus scale, purity, and the match between data and training objectives are critical. We address this by constructing a large, music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens) that combines open source and in-house data, and by implementing a domain-first data pipeline: a lightweight classifier filters and weights in-domain text, followed by multi-stage cleaning, de-duplication, and privacy-preserving masking. We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment. To assess factuality, we design the MusicSimpleQA benchmark, which adopts short, single-answer prompts with automated agreement scoring. Beyond the benchmark design, we conduct systematic comparisons along the axes of data composition. Overall, this work advances both the right corpus and the right objective, offering a scalable data-training framework and a reusable evaluation tool for building domain LLMs in the music field.

### [140] [Towards Authentic Movie Dubbing with Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14249)
*Rui Liu,Yuan Zhao,Zhenqi Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Authentic-Dubber is a movie dubbing model that simulates director-actor collaboration using multimodal reference footage, emotion-based retrieval, and progressive graph-based speech generation to improve emotional expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dubbing approaches overlook the critical director-actor interaction where directors guide actors to internalize emotional context before performance, leading to less authentic results.

Method: Proposes a Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme with three mechanisms: multimodal Reference Footage library with LLM comprehension, Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation, and Progressive Graph-based speech generation.

Result: Achieves comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness, validated by subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed Authentic-Dubber faithfully replicates authentic dubbing workflow and significantly enhances emotional expressiveness in automatic movie dubbing.

Abstract: The automatic movie dubbing model generates vivid speech from given scripts, replicating a speaker's timbre from a brief timbre prompt while ensuring lip-sync with the silent video. Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/Authentic-Dubber.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AfriSpeech-MultiBench is the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and 7 application domains, benchmarking various ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems to address the lack of application-specific model evaluation for Africa's linguistic diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread interest in voice interfaces globally, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity, creating a gap in inclusive voice technology development for underserved African communities.

Method: Created AfriSpeech-MultiBench evaluation suite covering 100+ African English accents across 10+ countries and 7 domains (Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities, Hallucination Robustness), benchmarking diverse open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech from various African accented English datasets.

Result: Open-source ASR models excel in spontaneous speech but degrade on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust but struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain; models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, though hallucinations remain problematic for most SOTA models.

Conclusion: The comprehensive AfriSpeech-MultiBench benchmark empowers practitioners and researchers to select voice technologies suited to African use-cases, fostering inclusive voice applications for underserved communities by addressing the evaluation gap for Africa's linguistic diversity.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled AI, including Google's NotebookLM and OpenAI's speech-to-speech API, are driving widespread interest in voice interfaces globally. Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark, we empower practitioners and researchers to select voice technologies suited to African use-cases, fostering inclusive voice applications for underserved communities.

### [142] [Entropy-Guided Reasoning Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14258)
*Hourun Zhu,Yang Gao,Wenlong Fei,Jiawei Li,Huashan Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of excessive chain-of-thought output length in large reasoning models by identifying and resolving the entropy conflict during compression training, achieving 80% length reduction while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models produce excessively long chain-of-thought outputs, creating practical bottlenecks due to high computation costs and poor deployability. Existing compression methods overlook the entropy conflict phenomenon during training.

Method: The authors propose an entropy-guided training framework that dynamically adjusts training based on entropy changes: encouraging concise reasoning when entropy decreases, and reinforcing exploration when entropy rises, all while maintaining compact reasoning modes.

Result: Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show the method compresses reasoning length to 20% of the original while maintaining or even surpassing baseline accuracy.

Conclusion: The entropy-guided training framework successfully resolves the entropy conflict in reasoning model compression, enabling significant length reduction without sacrificing performance, making large reasoning models more practical for deployment.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet the excessive length of their chain-of-thought outputs remains a major practical bottleneck due to high computation cost and poor deployability. Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness. Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show that our method compresses reasoning length to 20% of the original while maintaining or even surpassing baseline accuracy. Code and models will be released publicly.

*Ante Wang,Weizhi Ma,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using verbalized probability distributions to improve confidence estimation in LLMs, showing it encourages deeper reasoning and works across models and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for estimating model reliability rely on verbalized confidence combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, but how reasoning strategies affect confidence estimation remains under-explored.

Method: The approach involves having LLMs predict verbalized probability distributions over answer candidates, which forces consideration of all possible answers and careful confidence assignment.

Result: The method shows advantages across different models and tasks, works whether the answer space is known or not, maintains benefits after reinforcement learning, and produces reasoning patterns aligned with human expectations.

Conclusion: Predicting verbalized probability distributions effectively encourages in-depth reasoning for confidence estimation and provides reliable confidence scores across various conditions.

Abstract: Knowing the reliability of a model's response is essential in application. With the strong generation capabilities of LLMs, research has focused on generating verbalized confidence. This is further enhanced by combining chain-of-thought reasoning, which provides logical and transparent estimation. However, how reasoning strategies affect the estimated confidence is still under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that predicting a verbalized probability distribution can effectively encourage in-depth reasoning for confidence estimation. Intuitively, it requires an LLM to consider all candidates within the answer space instead of basing on a single guess, and to carefully assign confidence scores to meet the requirements of a distribution. This method shows an advantage across different models and various tasks, regardless of whether the answer space is known. Its advantage is maintained even after reinforcement learning, and further analysis shows its reasoning patterns are aligned with human expectations.

Motivation: To address the gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery in Arabic LLMs, revealing that current models often succeed through memorization rather than authentic comprehension.

Method: Created a fully human-annotated benchmark with 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions spanning five core linguistic categories, then evaluated 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs.

Result: Current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning, highlighting a persistent gap between knowledge-based performance and true linguistic mastery.

Conclusion: AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs by isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, with evaluation code publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: We present AraLingBench: a fully human annotated benchmark for evaluating the Arabic linguistic competence of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark spans five core categories: grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax, through 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions that directly assess structural language understanding. Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. AraLingBench highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension. By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.

*Xingwei He,Qianru Zhang,Pengfei Chen,Guanhua Chen,Linlin Yu,Yuan Yuan,Siu-Ming Yiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConInstruct benchmark evaluates LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicting constraints in instructions, revealing that while proprietary LLMs detect conflicts well, they rarely notify users or request clarification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works focus on LLM instruction-following but overlook scenarios with conflicting constraints in complex prompts, leaving LLM behavior under such conditions unexplored.

Method: Introduces ConInstruct benchmark to assess LLMs' conflict detection and resolution abilities, evaluating performance across various models including proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Result: Proprietary LLMs show strong conflict detection (DeepSeek-R1: 91.5% F1, Claude-4.5-Sonnet: 87.3% F1), but LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about conflicts or request clarification despite detection capabilities.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have a critical shortcoming in not communicating detected conflicts to users, highlighting an important area for future improvement in instruction-following LLM design.

Abstract: Instruction-following is a critical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing works primarily focus on assessing how well LLMs adhere to user instructions, they often overlook scenarios where instructions contain conflicting constraints-a common occurrence in complex prompts. The behavior of LLMs under such conditions remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Using this dataset, we evaluate LLMs' conflict detection performance and analyze their conflict resolution behavior. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) Most proprietary LLMs exhibit strong conflict detection capabilities, whereas among open-source models, only DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates similarly strong performance. DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest average F1-scores at 91.5% and 87.3%, respectively, ranking first and second overall. (2) Despite their strong conflict detection abilities, LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about the conflicts or request clarification when faced with conflicting constraints. These results underscore a critical shortcoming in current LLMs and highlight an important area for future improvement when designing instruction-following LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks suffer from performance saturation, narrow disciplinary focus, oversimplified answer formats, and vulnerability to data contamination, creating a gap with real scientific inquiry.

Method: Developed 800 original problems across 7 scientific fields by PhD-level experts, featuring contamination-resistant questions, cross-disciplinary integration, complex open-ended answers with LaTeX formatting, and rigorous multi-stage peer review.

Result: Preliminary results show ATLAS effectively differentiates advanced scientific reasoning capabilities of leading models, providing better discrimination than existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: ATLAS serves as a reliable evaluation platform for measuring progress toward AGI and will be developed into a long-term, open, community-driven benchmark.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to performance saturation on many established benchmarks, questioning their ability to distinguish frontier models. Concurrently, existing high-difficulty benchmarks often suffer from narrow disciplinary focus, oversimplified answer formats, and vulnerability to data contamination, creating a fidelity gap with real-world scientific inquiry. To address these challenges, we introduce ATLAS (AGI-Oriented Testbed for Logical Application in Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed by domain experts (PhD-level and above), ATLAS spans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers. Preliminary results on leading models demonstrate ATLAS's effectiveness in differentiating their advanced scientific reasoning capabilities. We plan to develop ATLAS into a long-term, open, community-driven platform to provide a reliable "ruler" for progress toward Artificial General Intelligence.

### [147] [Mitigating Label Length Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14385)
*Mario Sanz-Guerrero,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses label length bias in LLMs where multi-token class labels are treated inconsistently, and proposes Normalized Contextual Calibration (NCC) to mitigate this bias at the full-label level, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from label biases when predicting over candidate options, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels, leading to inconsistent treatment of labels with different lengths even after standard normalization.

Method: Proposed Normalized Contextual Calibration (NCC), which normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level rather than individual tokens, extending bias mitigation to broader tasks like multiple-choice question answering.

Result: NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. When combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates.

Conclusion: Mitigating full-label biases is crucial for improving LLM performance and robustness, especially in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens, and NCC provides an effective solution for this challenge.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful zero- and few-shot learners. However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer from label biases, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels. We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating full-label biases to improve the performance and robustness of LLM-based methods, particularly in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens.

TL;DR: EduHarm benchmark and TSSF framework address safety vulnerabilities in educational LLMs against jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks through attention realignment, layer-wise safety judgment, and dual routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in education are vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks that compromise safety alignment, but existing safety evaluations lack focus on educational scenarios' unique requirements.

Method: Three-stage shield framework: 1) Safety-aware attention realignment to restore harmfulness features, 2) Layer-wise safety judgment aggregating safety cues across layers, 3) Defense-driven dual routing separating safe/unsafe queries.

Result: Extensive experiments show TSSF effectively strengthens safety against 8 jailbreak strategies while preventing over-refusal of benign queries, and provides robust defense against fine-tuning attacks while maintaining utility gains.

Conclusion: TSSF framework successfully addresses educational LLM safety vulnerabilities by simultaneously mitigating jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks through a comprehensive three-stage defense mechanism.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into educational applications. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment and lead to harmful outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an evaluation framework that reflects real clinical workflows and safety constraints for advancing medical AI, addressing the need for comprehensive benchmarking that aligns with clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities.

Method: Nationwide cloud-based infrastructure with 700,000+ expert-curated tasks across 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, featuring multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from 500+ institutions, using LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings for open-ended responses.

Result: Base LLMs achieve mean score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100) with poor safety (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100). Agents substantially improve performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety.

Conclusion: Significant gaps remain in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, but governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance clinical readiness without sacrificing capability, providing a practical reference for medical AI auditing.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, and agents demand evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical workflows and safety constraints. We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI.

Motivation: To provide accessible mental health support, address shortage of therapeutic data, and demonstrate how conversational AI can complement existing care while lowering barriers to support.

Method: Three-component architecture: retrieval-augmented generation assistant, synthetic dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles, and CrewAI-based well-being crew for self-care plans and meditation audio.

Result: System evaluated in curated well-being scenarios using automatic LLM-based judgments and human-user study, demonstrating personalized support capabilities.

Conclusion: Highlights opportunities for NLP-mental health collaboration to advance responsible human-AI interaction for well-being, serving as reflective space rather than therapy substitute.

Abstract: We present Tell Me, a mental well-being system that leverages advances in large language models to provide accessible, context-aware support for users and researchers. The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study. This work highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and mental health professionals to advance responsible innovation in human-AI interaction for well-being.

Method: Systematically extended MDP framework for LLM Agents and developed Agent-R1 - a modular, flexible training framework for RL-based LLM Agents.

Result: Experiments on Multihop QA benchmark tasks provided initial validation of the proposed methods and framework effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper presents foundational work in RL methodologies for LLM Agents and introduces a practical framework to advance this emerging research area.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored for building Agents capable of active environmental interaction (e.g., via tool use) to solve complex problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered a key technology with significant potential for training such Agents; however, the effective application of RL to LLM Agents is still in its nascent stages and faces considerable challenges. Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adaptation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments. We conducted experiments on Multihop QA benchmark tasks, providing initial validation for the effectiveness of our proposed methods and framework.

Abstract: With Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becoming more and more prominent in generative AI solutions, there is an emerging need for systematically evaluating their effectiveness. We introduce the LiveRAG benchmark, a publicly available dataset of 895 synthetic questions and answers designed to support systematic evaluation of RAG-based Q&A systems. This synthetic benchmark is derived from the one used during the SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge, where competitors were evaluated under strict time constraints. It is augmented with information that was not made available to competitors during the Challenge, such as the ground-truth answers, together with their associated supporting claims which were used for evaluating competitors' answers. In addition, each question is associated with estimated difficulty and discriminability scores, derived from applying an Item Response Theory model to competitors' responses. Our analysis highlights the benchmark's questions diversity, the wide range of their difficulty levels, and their usefulness in differentiating between system capabilities. The LiveRAG benchmark will hopefully help the community advance RAG research, conduct systematic evaluation, and develop more robust Q&A systems.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating document-level claim extraction by proposing alignment methods to compare model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, tested on Czech and Slovak news comments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document-level claim extraction is an open challenge in fact-checking, and current evaluation methods for extracted claims have received limited attention, highlighting the need for reliable evaluation frameworks.

Method: The authors explore approaches to align two sets of claims from the same source document and compute similarity through alignment scores, investigating techniques to identify optimal alignment and evaluation methods between claim sets.

Result: Experiments on Czech and Slovak news comment datasets reveal limitations of current evaluation approaches for document-level claim extraction, particularly due to informal language, strong local context, and language subtleties.

Conclusion: There is a need for more advanced evaluation methods that can properly capture semantic similarity and assess essential claim properties like atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization in document-level claim extraction.

Abstract: Document-level claim extraction remains an open challenge in the field of fact-checking, and subsequently, methods for evaluating extracted claims have received limited attention. In this work, we explore approaches to aligning two sets of claims pertaining to the same source document and computing their similarity through an alignment score. We investigate techniques to identify the best possible alignment and evaluation method between claim sets, with the aim of providing a reliable evaluation framework. Our approach enables comparison between model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, serving as a metric for assessing the extraction performance of models and also as a possible measure of inter-annotator agreement. We conduct experiments on newly collected dataset-claims extracted from comments under Czech and Slovak news articles-domains that pose additional challenges due to the informal language, strong local context, and subtleties of these closely related languages. The results draw attention to the limitations of current evaluation approaches when applied to document-level claim extraction and highlight the need for more advanced methods-ones able to correctly capture semantic similarity and evaluate essential claim properties such as atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging.

Method: Used electronic health record data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution, identified post-AKI clinical states by clustering patient vectors from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements, and estimated transition probabilities using multi-state modeling.

Result: Of 20,699 AKI patients, 17% developed CKD. Identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states with different CKD probabilities. Most patients (75%) remained in a single state or made only one transition. Both established and novel CKD risk factors were identified, with varying impact across clinical states.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.

Abstract: Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.

TL;DR: This study compares human and LLM perceptions of political bias in news media, finding that RoBERTa aligns best with human labels among transformer models, while GPT shows strongest zero-shot agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how well large language models align with human judgment in detecting political bias in news media, as this remains relatively underexplored despite advances in NLP.

Method: Constructed a manually annotated dataset of news articles and evaluated bias detection across human annotations and multiple LLMs (GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, FLAN) using annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement metrics.

Result: RoBERTa achieved highest alignment with human labels among traditional transformer models, while GPT demonstrated strongest overall agreement in zero-shot setting. Fine-tuned RoBERTa obtained highest accuracy and strongest alignment with human annotations.

Conclusion: Systematic differences exist in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, highlighting the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks combining human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection.

Abstract: Detecting political bias in news media is a complex task that requires interpreting subtle linguistic and contextual cues. Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels. Our findings highlight systematic differences in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, underscoring the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection.

Motivation: To enhance autonomous scientific discovery by leveraging vision-language models to evaluate and guide exploratory data analysis through visual plot verification.

Method: Multi-agent systems guided by VLMs that treat plots as verifiable checkpoints, using VLM-as-a-judge to evaluate figures against dynamically generated domain-specific rubrics for real-time error correction.

Result: Achieved pass at 1 scores of 0.7-0.8 on 10-task benchmark, outperforming code-only (0.2-0.3) and code-and-text baselines (0.4-0.5), with successful case studies in cosmology and astrochemistry.

Conclusion: VLM-augmented systems significantly improve autonomous scientific discovery performance while providing auditable reasoning traces for better interpretability.

Abstract: We show that multi-agent systems guided by vision-language models (VLMs) improve end-to-end autonomous scientific discovery. By treating plots as verifiable checkpoints, a VLM-as-a-judge evaluates figures against dynamically generated domain-specific rubrics, enabling agents to correct their own errors and steer exploratory data analysis in real-time. Case studies in cosmology and astrochemistry demonstrate recovery from faulty reasoning paths and adaptation to new datasets without human intervention. On a 10-task benchmark for data-driven discovery, VLM-augmented systems achieve pass at 1 scores of 0.7-0.8, compared to 0.2-0.3 for code-only and 0.4-0.5 for code-and-text baselines, while also providing auditable reasoning traces that improve interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lengthy diagnostic odyssey for rare diseases by overcoming limitations of conventional pipelines and general LLMs that face scarce EHR data, stale knowledge, and hallucinations.

Method: Developed RareSeek R1 through staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph-grounded retrieval using a large domain-specialized clinical corpus and clinician-validated reasoning set.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, with robust generalization and stability under noisy/overlapping phenotypes. Human studies showed performance on par with experienced physicians.

Conclusion: The work advances a narrative-first, knowledge-integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support for rare diseases.

Abstract: Rare diseases affect hundreds of millions worldwide, yet diagnosis often spans years. Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.

### [158] [Graded strength of comparative illusions is explained by Bayesian inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14642)
*Yuhan Zhang,Erxiao Wang,Cory Shain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study develops a quantitative model using Bayesian inference and statistical language models to explain the strength of comparative illusions in language processing, showing that illusion strength correlates with posterior probabilities of plausible interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test and extend the noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by quantitatively predicting the strength of comparative illusions, particularly addressing previously unexplained effects of pronominal vs. full noun phrase subjects.

Method: Developed a quantitative model combining statistical language models with human behavioral data to calculate posterior probabilities of plausible interpretations of comparative illusion sentences through Bayesian inference.

Result: The model successfully explains fine gradations in comparative illusion strength and resolves the previously unexplained effect of pronominal vs. full noun phrase subjects in than-clauses, supporting noisy-channel theory predictions.

Conclusion: Noisy-channel inference serves as a unified computational-level theory for diverse language processing phenomena, including both illusory and non-illusory contexts, as demonstrated through quantitative modeling of comparative illusions.

Abstract: Like visual processing, language processing is susceptible to illusions in which people systematically misperceive stimuli. In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.

*Xiaoxing Lian,Aidong Yang,Jun Zhu,Peng Wang,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SpatiaLite benchmark reveals VLMs struggle with visual spatial reasoning, relying heavily on linguistic representations instead of internal spatial simulations, and proposes an Imagery Driven Framework to improve spatial reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current advanced vision language models (VLMs) show remarkable reasoning capabilities but struggle with spatial reasoning tasks that require mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension - fundamental components of human cognition.

Method: Introduced SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark to jointly measure spatial reasoning accuracy and efficiency, and proposed an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training to implicitly construct internal world models.

Result: Three key findings: 1) VLMs predominantly use linguistic representations rather than visual/spatial simulations, 2) VLMs show severe inefficiency with token usage growing rapidly with transformation complexity, 3) The proposed IDF framework can help build internal world models for spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: The work delineates spatial reasoning limits of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings in current approaches, and provides a framework to inform future advances in building models with better spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KANGURA is a novel 3D machine learning framework that uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for geometry-aware learning to optimize microbial fuel cell anode structures, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both benchmark datasets and real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing predictive models struggle to capture complex geometric dependencies needed to optimize anode structures in Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs), which are crucial for sustainable energy generation through microbial processes.

Method: KANGURA formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based representation learning, geometry-disentangled representation learning to separate structural variations, and unified attention mechanisms to enhance critical geometric regions.

Result: KANGURA outperforms 15+ state-of-the-art models on ModelNet40 with 92.7% accuracy and achieves 97% accuracy on real-world MFC anode structure problems.

Conclusion: KANGURA establishes a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, enabling optimization of complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.

Abstract: Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) offer a promising pathway for sustainable energy generation by converting organic matter into electricity through microbial processes. A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extension of Bjøru et al.'s divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities from Markovian to semi-Markovian structural causal models, addressing challenges with exogenous variables affecting multiple endogenous variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend counterfactual probability bounding methods to semi-Markovian SCMs, which can represent confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot capture, addressing the limitations of previous Markovian-only approaches.

Method: Investigates extension challenges using minimal examples and proposes alternative solution strategies, evaluating them both theoretically and through computational studies.

Result: The paper identifies challenges in extending the methodology to semi-Markovian models and develops alternative strategies to address these challenges.

Conclusion: Successfully extends counterfactual bounding methodology to semi-Markovian SCMs, enabling representation of confounding relationships and providing theoretical and computational validation of the proposed strategies.

Abstract: Recently, Bjøru et al. proposed a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities in structural causal models (SCMs). They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.

Motivation: LVLMs are increasingly used in ITS applications but are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, posing security risks in critical transportation infrastructure.

Method: Constructed a transportation-specific harmful query dataset, developed a novel jailbreaking attack using image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting, and designed a multi-layered response filtering defense technique.

Result: Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LVLMs showed the effectiveness of the proposed attack method and defense mechanism, with evaluation using GPT-4 judgment and manual verification.

Conclusion: The study highlights severe security risks in LVLMs integrated in ITS and demonstrates that image typography manipulation combined with multi-turn prompting poses significant jailbreaking threats that require robust defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and many real-world applications, such as visual question answering. However, LVLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification. Further, we compare our proposed jailbreaking method with existing jailbreaking techniques and highlight severe security risks involved with jailbreaking attacks with image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting in the LVLMs integrated in ITS.

### [163] [CORGI: Efficient Pattern Matching With Quadratic Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13942)
*Daniel Weitekamp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CORGI is a new pattern-matching algorithm that provides quadratic time/space guarantees for finding matches, addressing exponential complexity issues in rule-based systems by using a two-step graph approach instead of traditional RETE's β-memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based systems face exponential time/space issues with complex matching patterns, especially when AI systems automatically generate rules through induction or synthesis, leading to unpredictable failures and memory overflows in real-time applications.

Method: CORGI uses a two-step approach: building/maintaining a graph of grounded relations in a forward pass, then generating matches iteratively by working backward through the graph, eliminating the need for traditional β-memory and full conflict sets.

Result: CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on combinatorial matching tasks, providing quadratic time/space guarantees and avoiding memory overflows.

Conclusion: CORGI makes rule-based systems practical for real-time applications by providing predictable performance guarantees and eliminating the unpredictable failure modes that plague traditional RETE-based approaches.

Abstract: Rule-based systems must solve complex matching problems within tight time constraints to be effective in real-time applications, such as planning and reactive control for AI agents, as well as low-latency relational database querying. Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.

TL;DR: A novel framework that uses scene graphs guided by OSHA accident reports to generate photorealistic images of workplace hazards, with a VQA-based evaluation method that outperforms existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training vision models for workplace hazard detection requires realistic images of unsafe conditions, but capturing actual accident-triggering scenarios is nearly impossible due to safety and practical constraints.

Method: Uses GPT-4o to analyze OSHA accident reports and extract structured hazard reasoning, converts this into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial relationships, then guides a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. Introduces a VQA framework for evaluation.

Result: The proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics across four state-of-the-art generative models based on entropy-based validation, confirming higher discriminative sensitivity for evaluating realism and semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: The scene graph-guided generative AI framework successfully synthesizes photorealistic workplace hazard images from OSHA reports, with the VQA evaluation method providing superior assessment of generated data quality compared to existing metrics.

Abstract: Training vision models to detect workplace hazards accurately requires realistic images of unsafe conditions that could lead to accidents. However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.

The pedagogical implications are evaluated through a dual-case methodology: (1) the use of generative AI platforms in secondary education to foster analytical and creative skills; (2) the design of a multiagent system for symbolic music analysis, enabling modular, scalable, and explainable workflows.
  Experimental results demonstrate that AI agents effectively enhance musical pattern recognition, compositional parameterization, and educational feedback, outperforming traditional automated methods in terms of interpretability and adaptability. The findings highlight key challenges concerning transparency, cultural bias, and the definition of hybrid evaluation metrics, emphasizing the need for responsible deployment of AI in educational environments.
  This research contributes to a unified framework that bridges technical, pedagogical, and ethical considerations, offering evidence-based guidance for the design and application of intelligent agents in computational musicology and music education.

Conclusion: ALEX presents a promising approach for building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems by addressing fundamental challenges in retrieval complexity and multi-hop reasoning.

Abstract: The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.

*Chiharu Hagiwara,Naoki Nonaka,Yuhta Hashimoto,Ryu Uchimido,Jun Seita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Syn-STARTS is an LLM-based framework for generating synthetic triage cases that are indistinguishable from manually curated real data, enabling development of AI models for mass casualty incidents where real data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mass casualty incidents occur infrequently, making it difficult to collect sufficient real-world triage data for AI development and evaluation, necessitating synthetic data generation methods.

Method: Developed Syn-STARTS framework using Large Language Models to generate synthetic triage cases, then compared them against the manually curated TRIAGE open dataset for qualitative indistinguishability and evaluated LLM accuracy across different triage categories (green, yellow, red, black) using the standard START method.

Result: Generated triage cases were qualitatively indistinguishable from manually curated real data, and LLM evaluation showed highly stable accuracy across hundreds of cases in all four triage categories.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation using LLMs shows strong potential for developing high-performance AI models in critical medical situations where real data collection is challenging.

Abstract: Triage is a critically important decision-making process in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to maximize victim survival rates. While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.

*Amirreza Mehrabi,Jason W. Morphew,Breejha Quezada,N. Sanjay Rebello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents an instructor-governed adaptive learning system with three safeguards (adequacy, attention, diversity) that converts concept-level assessments into vetted micro-interventions using binary integer programming and achieves full skill coverage for students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the problem that adaptive learning often provides precise diagnosis but weak interventions, resulting in mistimed or misaligned help that fails to effectively close learning gaps.

Method: Uses binary integer programming with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows, prerequisites, and anti-redundancy. Implements greedy selection for low-richness scenarios, gradient-based relaxation for rich repositories, and a hybrid method for transition scenarios.

Result: In simulation and deployment with 1,204 physics students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage within bounded watch time. Gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by ~12% compared to greedy, while greedy provided comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings.

Conclusion: The system provides a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale through localized missing content identification and targeted curation.

Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.

*Adit Jain,Vikram Krishnamurthy,Yiming Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper models how networks of LLMs collaboratively answer questions, analyzing how hallucinations spread through interactions and developing a mean-field dynamics model to study information diffusion in LLM networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in networks where hallucinations can spread and cause previously accurate LLMs to also hallucinate.

Method: Combines mean-field dynamics from network science and randomized utility model from economics to create a generative model. Models LLMs with latent truth states and analyzes information diffusion in directed networks using tractable analytical models.

Result: Establishes sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of fixed points, analyzes fixed point behavior with respect to incentives like test-time compute. Experiments with 100 open-source LLMs on semi-synthetic datasets study effects of data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and framing sensitivity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully models and analyzes hallucination spread in LLM networks, providing insights into how network interactions affect collaborative question-answering performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we model and analyze how a network of interacting LLMs performs collaborative question-answering (CQA) in order to estimate a ground truth given a distributed set of documents. This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: APD-agents is an LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates mobile app page layout design by parsing user descriptions, generating layouts, retrieving templates, and recursively creating sub-elements through collaborative agent interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile app layout design is time-consuming and requires extensive training with design software. Collaborative design across pages demands additional effort for consistency. The authors aim to automate this process using AI.

Method: A multi-agent framework with five specialized agents: OrchestratorAgent coordinates tasks, SemanticParserAgent converts descriptions to structured data, PrimaryLayoutAgent generates initial layouts, TemplateRetrievalAgent fetches relevant examples, and RecursiveComponentAgent handles fine-grained sub-element generation.

Result: Experimental results on the RICO dataset demonstrate that APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance in automated mobile app page design.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully leverages LLM-driven multi-agent collaboration to automate mobile app page design, reducing manual effort while maintaining high quality and consistency across designs.

Abstract: Layout design is a crucial step in developing mobile app pages. However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: R3 is a dual-process framework for Vision-and-Language Navigation that combines LLMs' reasoning with domain-specific expertise, achieving state-of-the-art performance on REVERIE benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance gap between LLM-based approaches and domain experts in VLN tasks, while reducing computational costs and inference latency associated with LLMs.

Method: Proposes R3 framework with three modules: Runner (lightweight transformer expert for efficient navigation), Ruminator (powerful multimodal LLM with chain-of-thought reasoning), and Regulator (monitors progress and controls thinking modes).

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 3.28% improvement in SPL and 3.30% in RGSPL on REVERIE benchmark.

Conclusion: The R3 framework effectively handles challenging VLN tasks by harmoniously integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions. Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.

*Sushant Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in current AI agent benchmarks that focus only on accuracy while ignoring enterprise needs like cost, reliability, and stability. It proposes CLEAR framework for holistic evaluation and shows that accuracy-optimized agents are 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agent benchmarks overlook critical enterprise requirements such as cost-efficiency, reliability, and operational stability, focusing only on task completion accuracy.

Method: Systematic analysis of 12 benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, followed by proposing the CLEAR framework (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability) and evaluating six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks with expert validation.

Result: Found 50x cost variations for similar precision, agent performance drops from 60% (single run) to 25% (8-run consistency), and accuracy-optimized agents are 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives. CLEAR better predicts production success (ρ=0.83) vs accuracy-only evaluation (ρ=0.41).

Conclusion: The CLEAR framework provides a more comprehensive evaluation approach for enterprise AI agent deployment, addressing critical gaps in current benchmarking practices and enabling better prediction of production success.

Abstract: Current agentic AI benchmarks predominantly evaluate task completion accuracy, while overlooking critical enterprise requirements such as cost-efficiency, reliability, and operational stability. Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\% (single run) to 25\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance. Expert evaluation (N=15) confirms that CLEAR better predicts production success (correlation $ρ=0.83$) compared to accuracy-only evaluation ($ρ=0.41$).

TL;DR: HFL-FlowLLM is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning, achieving significant improvements in F1 scores while reducing training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with distributed data and privacy concerns in 5G/IoT networks, while existing federated learning approaches have high costs and poor generalization for network traffic flow classification.

Method: Proposed HFL-FlowLLM framework that applies large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning environments.

Result: Improves average F1 score by ~13% compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieves up to 5% F1 improvement with increasing clients while reducing training costs by ~87% compared to existing LLM federated learning frameworks.

Conclusion: HFL-FlowLLM demonstrates strong potential and practical value for modern communication network security with compelling performance and robustness.

Abstract: In modern communication networks driven by 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), effective network traffic flow classification is crucial for Quality of Service (QoS) management and security. Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%. These findings prove the potential and practical value of HFL-FlowLLM in modern communication networks security.

### [174] [Do Large Language Models (LLMs) Understand Chronology?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14214)
*Pattaraphon Kenny Wongchamcharoen,Paul Glasserman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with chronological ordering tasks despite knowing facts from pre-training, with performance declining as sequence length increases. GPT-5 with medium/high reasoning effort achieves flawless performance, while explicit reasoning allocation significantly helps with chronological tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether LLMs fundamentally understand chronology, which is crucial for their applications in finance and economics where look-ahead bias must be avoided.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet (with/without Extended Thinking), and GPT-5 on three chronological tasks: (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter then order), and (3) anachronism detection across multiple reasoning-effort settings.

Result: Exact match rates drop sharply with longer sequences while rank correlations remain high. LLMs preserve local order but struggle with global timeline consistency. Conditional sorting failures mainly come from filtering rather than ordering. GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outperform normal models significantly.

Conclusion: Allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering, with GPT-5 achieving flawless performance at medium/high reasoning effort. Current LLMs have limitations on chronological tasks, and reasoning allocation is crucial for real-time financial applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.

*Kumud Tripathi,Aditya Srinivas Menon,Aman Gaurav,Raj Prakash Gohil,Pankaj Wasnik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a two-stage architecture to reduce hallucinations in Whisper ASR models under noisy conditions, using Adaptive Layer Attention for robust encoding and multi-objective knowledge distillation to suppress hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper models suffer from hallucination errors in noisy acoustic conditions, and previous approaches focused on pre/post-processing rather than modifying the model itself to directly address hallucinations.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Adaptive Layer Attention groups encoder layers into semantic blocks and fuses representations using multi-head attention; 2) Multi-objective knowledge distillation trains student on noisy audio to align with teacher processing clean inputs.

Result: Experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates while preserving performance on clean speech.

Conclusion: The combination of ALA and KD provides a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability in real-world noisy conditions.

Abstract: The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.

Abstract: Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics.

*Hongju Lee,Youngjun Park,Jisun An,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study develops a novel time-series forecasting framework using LLM-generated regional embeddings to predict Airbnb market trends (Revenue, Reservation Days, Number of Reservations) 1-3 months ahead, achieving 48% improvement in accuracy over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expansion of short-term rental platforms like Airbnb has disrupted local housing markets, increasing rental prices and affordability issues. Accurate forecasting of regional Airbnb trends provides critical insights for policymakers and urban planners to mitigate these impacts.

Method: Proposes a sliding-window forecasting framework that constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors (urban accessibility, human mobility). Converts tabular data into prompt-based inputs for LLM to generate comprehensive regional embeddings, then feeds these into time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to capture spatio-temporal dynamics.

Result: Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show the method reduces average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines including traditional statistical and machine learning models.

Conclusion: The framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

Abstract: The expansion of short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, has significantly disrupted local housing markets, often leading to increased rental prices and housing affordability issues. Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

*Yu Liu,Xixun Lin,Yanmin Shang,Yangxi Li,Shi Wang,Yanan Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PathMind is a novel framework that enhances knowledge graph reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths using a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm with semantic-aware path prioritization and dual-phase training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based KGR methods face two key limitations: indiscriminate path extraction that introduces irrelevant noise, and high computational demands from frequent LLM calls during dynamic path exploration.

Method: PathMind follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm: retrieves query subgraphs, prioritizes paths using semantic-aware path priority function considering accumulative and future costs, and generates responses via dual-phase training (task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment).

Result: Extensive experiments show PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, especially on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

Conclusion: PathMind effectively addresses limitations of existing LLM-based KGR methods by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths, achieving superior performance through faithful and interpretable reasoning.

Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is the task of inferring new knowledge by performing logical deductions on knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-driven data insight agents have limitations including insufficient domain knowledge utilization, shallow analytical depth, and error-prone code generation, which prevent them from delivering satisfactory automated insight discovery results.

Method: DataSage uses a multi-agent framework with three key features: external knowledge retrieval to enrich analytical context, multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analysis, and multi-path reasoning to improve code and insight accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments on InsightBench show that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, demonstrating superior performance in automated data insight discovery.

Conclusion: DataSage provides an effective solution for automated data insight discovery by addressing key limitations of existing approaches through its innovative multi-agent framework design.

Abstract: In today's data-driven era, fully automated end-to-end data analytics, particularly insight discovery, is critical for discovering actionable insights that assist organizations in making effective decisions. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.

### [180] [When Words Change the Model: Sensitivity of LLMs for Constraint Programming Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14334)
*Alessio Pellegrino,Jacopo Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can generate executable models for standard constraint programming problems, but their performance significantly declines when problems are rephrased or modified, suggesting data contamination rather than genuine reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs' apparent success in automatically generating constraint programming models stems from genuine reasoning or data contamination of standard benchmarks in their training data.

Method: Systematically rephrased and perturbed well-known CSPLib problems to preserve structure while changing context and adding misleading elements, then compared model generation performance across original and modified descriptions using three representative LLMs.

Result: LLMs produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models for original problems, but performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variations, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate limited genuine reasoning capabilities for constraint programming, with their apparent success largely attributable to data contamination rather than deep problem understanding.

Abstract: One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

*Dalia Ali,Dora Zhao,Allison Koenecke,Orestis Papakyriakopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines how incorporating pluralistic human values affects LLM alignment, revealing systematic demographic variations in preference ratings and showing that technical design choices significantly impact model behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment often overlooks human social diversity, focusing on safety and human values without considering pluralistic perspectives from different demographic groups.

Method: Collected alignment data from 1,095 US and German participants (27,375 ratings) across five dimensions, fine-tuned multiple LLMs using group-specific preferences while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques.

Result: Found systematic demographic effects (e.g., male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than females), and technical choices showed strong impacts (53% greater toxicity reduction with disagreement preservation vs majority voting, 22% more reduction with 5-point vs binary scales, DPO outperformed GRPO).

Conclusion: This represents a preliminary step toward understanding how alignment should balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation across diverse social groups.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?

*Jiahao Wu,Shengwen Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic framework that bridges perception and planning by explicitly modeling and propagating uncertainty from visual observations to symbolic reasoning, achieving high success rates in robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental challenge of connecting continuous perceptual signals with discrete symbolic reasoning under uncertainty in AI systems, particularly for applications like robotic manipulation.

Method: Couples transformer-based perceptual front-end with GNN relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, combined with uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low.

Result: Achieved 94%/90%/88% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7% average), exceeding POMDP baselines by 10-14 points while planning within 15ms. Translator processed 10,047 scenes and output probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (F1=0.68).

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled connection between perception and planning with theoretical guarantees linking calibrated uncertainty to planning convergence, and is general-purpose for domains requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perception to symbolic planning.

Abstract: Bridging continuous perceptual signals and discrete symbolic reasoning is a fundamental challenge in AI systems that must operate under uncertainty. We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\%/90\%/88\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.

*Yuan An,Ruhma Hashmi,Michelle Rogers,Jane Greenberg,Brian K. Smith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework using rate-distortion theory and optimal transport geometry to automatically construct and refine knowledge graphs from educational materials, enabling generation of high-quality multiple-choice questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Converting unstructured educational materials like lecture notes into task-oriented knowledge graphs that capture key pedagogical content remains challenging, limiting the effectiveness of AI-powered learning systems.

Method: Models lecture content as metric-measure spaces and uses Fused Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to align candidate KGs, with refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) that minimize rate-distortion Lagrangian to create compact, information-preserving KGs.

Result: Applied to data science lectures, the method produces interpretable rate-distortion curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently outperform those from raw notes across fifteen quality criteria.

Conclusion: Establishes a principled information-theoretic foundation for knowledge graph optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education systems.

Abstract: Task-oriented knowledge graphs (KGs) enable AI-powered learning assistant systems to automatically generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria. This study establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education.

### [184] [AutoTool: Efficient Tool Selection for Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14650)
*Jingyi Jia,Qinbin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoTool is a graph-based framework that reduces LLM inference costs by modeling tool usage inertia from historical trajectories, achieving up to 30% cost reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent frameworks suffer from high inference costs in tool selection, particularly in approaches like ReAct that repeatedly invoke LLMs to choose tools at each step.

Method: Constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, modeling tool usage inertia. Integrates parameter-level information for refined tool input generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates across diverse agent tasks.

Conclusion: AutoTool demonstrates the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance, offering a practical enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex tasks by leveraging the reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs. However, a major bottleneck in current agent frameworks lies in the high inference cost of tool selection, especially in approaches like ReAct that repeatedly invoke the LLM to determine which tool to use at each step. In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.

### [185] [FreeMusco: Motion-Free Learning of Latent Control for Morphology-Adaptive Locomotion in Musculoskeletal Characters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14205)
*Minkwan Kim,Yoonsang Lee*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FreeMusco is a motion-free framework that learns latent representations and control policies for musculoskeletal characters using model-based reinforcement learning, enabling energy-aware locomotion without motion data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a framework that can generate physically plausible and adaptive locomotion for musculoskeletal characters without relying on motion capture data, which is often impractical or impossible to collect for various morphologies.

Method: Uses model-based reinforcement learning with the musculoskeletal model as a prior, introduces temporally averaged loss formulation for gait periodicity, and randomizes target poses and energy levels during training to encourage behavioral diversity.

Result: Successfully generates diverse locomotion behaviors across human, non-human, and synthetic morphologies, with distinct energy-efficient strategies emerging naturally (e.g., quadrupedal gaits for Chimanoid, bipedal for Humanoid). Enables downstream tasks like goal navigation and path following.

Conclusion: Versatile and adaptive locomotion control can emerge without motion capture data, offering a new approach for simulating movement in characters where traditional data collection methods are impractical.

Abstract: We propose FreeMusco, a motion-free framework that jointly learns latent representations and control policies for musculoskeletal characters. By leveraging the musculoskeletal model as a strong prior, our method enables energy-aware and morphology-adaptive locomotion to emerge without motion data. The framework generalizes across human, non-human, and synthetic morphologies, where distinct energy-efficient strategies naturally appear--for example, quadrupedal gaits in Chimanoid versus bipedal gaits in Humanoid. The latent space and corresponding control policy are constructed from scratch, without demonstration, and enable downstream tasks such as goal navigation and path following--representing, to our knowledge, the first motion-free method to provide such capabilities. FreeMusco learns diverse and physically plausible locomotion behaviors through model-based reinforcement learning, guided by the locomotion objective that combines control, balancing, and biomechanical terms. To better capture the periodic structure of natural gait, we introduce the temporally averaged loss formulation, which compares simulated and target states over a time window rather than on a per-frame basis. We further encourage behavioral diversity by randomizing target poses and energy levels during training, enabling locomotion to be flexibly modulated in both form and intensity at runtime. Together, these results demonstrate that versatile and adaptive locomotion control can emerge without motion capture, offering a new direction for simulating movement in characters where data collection is impractical or impossible.
