Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes four novel extensions to model-based 6D object pose estimation to address occlusion challenges: dynamic non-uniform sampling, multi-hypothesis inference, iterative refinement, and occlusion-focused training augmentations, achieving significant accuracy improvements and faster inference.", "motivation": "Accurate 6D pose estimation is crucial for robotics and AR, but existing methods struggle with unseen objects and occlusion.

Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus.

We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities.

LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes.

MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection.

Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only \"simple\" samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.", "AI": {"tldr": "Self-rewriting framework improves reasoning quality in large reasoning models by having models rewrite their own reasoning texts and learn from the improved versions, addressing issues like over-thinking and disordered reasoning.", "motivation": "Current RL approaches with outcome correctness rewards provide limited supervision over internal reasoning processes, leading to suboptimal reasoning quality with issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking.", "method": "Proposes a self-rewriting framework where models rewrite their own reasoning texts, using selective rewriting on 'simple' samples (consistently correct) to preserve original reward signals.

Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated.

In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module.

However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22.

Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity.

To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD.

Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body.

The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models.

Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed.

In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture.

Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance.

In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing.

To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations.
